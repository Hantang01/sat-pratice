Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don&rsquo;t cross.

Choice D is incorrect because it states that Ramah and Tuba City had the same average lowest temperature (50&deg;) for July, which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations rather than a difference. </p>",

mined in the US for thousands of years, but large-scale commercial mining of copper took off starting in the late 1800s. This was due to several factors. Technological advancements in the mining industry led to improvements in the production of copper. This helped the country keep up with the growing number of people wanting to buy copper starting in the 1890s. At the same time, the growth of the railroad system made the transportation of copper in large batches much easier. Several states saw rapid growth in the production of this resource, for example: <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

Despite these pieces containing \"a rare form of lead,\" there is no direct claim in the passage that Shang dynasty bronze is itself more rare or valuable than bronze pieces from other periods. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the nature of the bronze in Chinese artifacts changed after the Shang dynasty, bronze was still used to create artifacts after this time. The passage in fact explicitly states \"bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty&hellip;,\" indicating that bronze was still used in China after the Shang dynasty. Choice D is incorrect. There&rsquo;s no mention in the passage of methods used to analyze bronze artifacts, so there&rsquo;s no basis for this inference.</p>",

The text notes that jaguars generally eat land-based mammals, but researchers claim that jaguars in the Pantanal can survive on a diet that includes more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. Finding that the remains of aquatic reptiles and fish appear more often in these jaguars&rsquo; waste than the remains of mammals do would support the researchers&rsquo; claim, since it would suggest that fish and aquatic reptiles are a more significant part of the jaguars&rsquo; diet than mammals are.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because finding that a particular aquatic reptile exists in high numbers in the area would not support the researchers&rsquo; claim about the jaguars&rsquo; diet. The mere presence of many aquatic reptiles nearby does not mean that the jaguars eat those reptiles, let alone survive on more aquatic reptiles and fish than mammals. Choice C is incorrect. Although finding that aquatic reptiles and fish can provide nutrients that land mammals typically do not provide could help explain why some animals eat those reptiles and fish, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in particular eat those reptiles and fish and thus would not support the researchers&rsquo; claim. Choice D is incorrect because finding that when preying on mammals, jaguars prefer semiaquatic mammals, such as capybaras, would be irrelevant to the researchers&rsquo; claim that the jaguars can survive on a diet of more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example. According to the graph, fewer than 10,000 sewing machines were sold in the Philippines in both 1903 and 1908, but nearly 30,000 were sold in 1913 and around 45,000 were sold in 1918. This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe the data in the graph. Although sales in Australia did increase somewhat between 1903 and 1908, there was very little change between 1908 and 1913, and then sales declined between 1913 and 1918. The data for Australia, then, do not show a steady increase from 1903 to 1918. Choice D is incorrect because declining sales of Singer sewing machines in Turkey from 1913 to 1918 do not point to an increase in demand for the product but rather to a decline in demand. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about average rainfall in September in select Puerto Rican cities. The graph shows that between 1981 and 2010 Rinc&oacute;n, Ponce, and Isabela all had an average rainfall during the month of September of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti&aacute;n had an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Describing the average September rainfall of Rinc&oacute;n, Ponce, and Isabela as below 8 inches and the average September rainfall of San Sebasti&aacute;n as greater than 8 inches therefore offers an accurate description of the data in the graph and most effectively completes the statement. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it offers an inaccurate interpretation of the data in the graph. The graph shows that in September, Rinc&oacute;n, Isabela, and Ponce all have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti&aacute;n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Therefore, Rinc&oacute;n&rsquo;s average rainfall is the same as, not greater than, that of Isabela and Ponce, and it is below, not greater than, that of San Sebasti&aacute;n. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph. In September, Rinc&oacute;n and Ponce have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, not 5 inches; Isabela has an average rainfall of about 6 inches, not 10 inches; and San Sebasti&aacute;n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches, not 10 inches. Choice D is incorrect because although the graph shows a similar average rainfall (about 6 inches) for Rinc&oacute;n and Isabela in September, it doesn&rsquo;t show that Ponce has a similar average rainfall to San Sebasti&aacute;n during this month. In September, Ponce&rsquo;s average rainfall is about 6 inches, whereas San Sebasti&aacute;n&rsquo;s average rainfall is nearly 11 inches. </p>",

The table shows the number of cars produced annually and number of companies producing cars in the United States between 1910 and 1925 in increments of five years. According to the table, the number of cars produced consistently increased from one increment to the next, going from 123,990 cars in 1910 to 3,185,881 cars in 1925. At the same time, the table shows that the number of companies producing cars consistently decreased, going from 320 companies in 1910 to only 80 companies in 1925. Thus, the table shows that the number of cars produced increased from 1910 to 1925, even as the number of companies producing cars decreased.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect.

The bike rider responds that they bike to work every day and that they use the bike lane because it is faster; thus, it is reasonable to assume that they are an experienced rider who prefers routes that reduce their travel time to work.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this response does not address the claim. The claim is about experienced riders preferring to take routes that reduce their travel time on the way to work; however, this response is from an inexperienced rider who is discussing biking for personal reasons. Choice B is incorrect because this response is not related to the underlined claim. The response from this rider does not establish the level of experience they have with riding, nor does it state that the rider uses a bike to get to work. Choice D is incorrect. Although this response is from an experienced rider who mainly bikes to work, the response also mentions that the rider&rsquo;s bike is broken, which is not related to any route preference.</p>",

The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows find and don&rsquo;t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools&mdash;but not the tools without hooks&mdash;in their grasp or in safe places when they aren&rsquo;t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren&rsquo;t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they&rsquo;re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren&rsquo;t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there&rsquo;s no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are. </p>",

Areas with mangroves are great places for young fish since they help keep these fish fed and protected while they grow. To study the importance of mangroves to young fish, researchers Mohamed A.Abu El-Regal and Nesreen K. Ibrahim collected and identified young fish from three different mangrove sites in the Egyptian Red Sea. They collected fish in the winter, spring, and autumn of 2010, collecting a total of 269 fish from 21 different species. For some species, more fish were collected in the winter than the other two seasons, for instance: <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

The graph shows the number of organic farms located in each of six US states in 2016: between 2,600 and 2,800 in California; between 1,200 and 1,400 in Wisconsin; between 1,000 and 1,200 in New York; approximately 800 in Pennsylvania; and between 600 and 800 in both Iowa and Washington.&nbsp;The last sentence of the text provides information about the number of organic farms in 2016, first describing the number in California. The best completion of the sentence is the choice that accurately describes the number of organic farms in 2016 in another state, which the assertion that Washington had between 600 and 800 organic farms provides. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. The graph indicates that there were between 1,000 and 1,200 organic farms in New York, not fewer than 800 organic farms.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. While the graph indicates that there were between 1,200 and 1,400 organic farms in Wisconsin in 2016, there were only between 600 and 800 in Iowa. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph.

The text also explains that melanosomes have different shapes depending on the colors they produce. Given this information, it follows that the scientists hypothesized that they could determine the colors of the extinct bird by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the feather.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to show how melanosomes can be found in fossils belonging to animals from other extinct species. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird&rsquo;s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird&rsquo;s fossilized feather. Choice C is incorrect because the text never suggests that the scientists were seeking to explain why the melanosomes in the feather were so well preserved. Rather, the text indicates that the scientists were seeking to identify an extinct bird&rsquo;s colors, and the text strongly suggests that the scientists hypothesized that they could achieve their goal by examining the shapes of the melanosomes in the bird&rsquo;s fossilized feather. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests only one method of identifying the colors of extinct animals: by examining the shapes of melanosomes found in fossils.

The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes&rsquo;s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes&rsquo;s book. If the reviewers of <em>One Last Word</em> specifically note that the work is a &ldquo;beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,&rdquo; then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes&rsquo;s goal for her book. According to the text, the reviewers noted that the poems in her book were a &ldquo;beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it.&rdquo; Earlier, the text claims that Grimes intended the poems &ldquo;to honor important Black poets of the past,&rdquo; so in their praise of her book, the reviewers clearly indicated that they understood Grimes&rsquo;s goal. Choice C is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they&rsquo;re among her favorite poets, this fact isn&rsquo;t suggested by the reviewers&rsquo; positive reaction to her book. Instead, the reaction suggests that Grimes was successful in her use of the golden shovel method.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether other writers were inspired by Grimes to use the golden shovel method in their poetry. The text mentions the poets Hughes and Johnson as examples of poets honored in Grimes&rsquo;s book and describes reviewers&rsquo; positive reception of her book, but it doesn&rsquo;t detail Grimes&rsquo;s impact on other writers. </p>",

Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t mention protests related to environmental protections. Rather, the text discusses Gloria Richardson&rsquo;s involvement in efforts to promote racial equality. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Gloria Richardson led a new business in Cambridge, Maryland. Rather, the text states that she led what became known as the Cambridge movement.</p>",

While the researchers are studying &ldquo;reef-building corals,&rdquo; the focus of their study isn&rsquo;t how the corals build the reefs. Rather, they&rsquo;re studying how corals may be storing microplastics from ocean waters. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t mention any unanswered questions about the impact of corals on ocean ecosystems&mdash;rather, the study assesses one interaction between corals and microplastics. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it&rsquo;s a detail&mdash;not the main idea.

The text states that Green found the storytelling in the 2016 off-Broadway version to be \"very confusing\" but that he \"enthusiastically praised\" the storytelling in the revised 2019 Broadway version. This stark contrast in Green&rsquo;s opinions suggests that he believed the musical had significantly improved between 2016 and its 2019 Broadway premiere.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts the information in the text. The text indicates that Green found the storytelling in the 2016 version to be \"very confusing,\" while he \"enthusiastically praised\" the storytelling in the 2019 version.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t provide any information about Green&rsquo;s opinion on the size of the 2019 Broadway production. While it mentions that the 2019 production was larger than the 2016 production, there&rsquo;s no indication in the text that Green thought the 2019 production should have been even larger than it was.

Meanwhile, the researchers tracked the amount of time each participant spent reading about each museum.
