    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms&rsquo; morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms&rsquo; structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers&rsquo; decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues&rsquo; count and Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri&rsquo;s study.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference&mdash;it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.&nbsp;</p>",

    "stimulus": "<p>Marta Coll and colleagues&rsquo; 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri&rsquo;s 2000 census&mdash;a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers&rsquo; decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that <em>fabula</em> and <em>syuzhet</em> can&rsquo;t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text&rsquo;s discussion of lizard species&rsquo; use of maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%&ndash;39% of maximal speed, 40%&ndash;49% of maximal speed, 50%&ndash;59% of maximal speed, 60%&ndash;69% of maximal speed, 70%&ndash;79% of maximal speed, 80%&ndash;89% of maximal speed, and 90%&ndash;100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%&ndash;59%, 60%&ndash;69%, 70%&ndash;79%, and 80%&ndash;89%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn&rsquo;t organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%&ndash;100% (8 species total). However, these data don&rsquo;t complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don&rsquo;t complete the text&rsquo;s discussion of lizard species&rsquo; use of maximal speed when escaping predators.</p>",

In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references&mdash;that is, clock phrases, such as 7 <span data-ssml-sub-alias=\"a m\">a.m.</span> or 2:30 <span data-ssml-sub-alias=\"p m\">p.m.</span>&mdash;and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that an observable pattern in time references in novels reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting&mdash;which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light&mdash;many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers&rsquo; conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this would reflect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively complete the example of Eludoyin and his colleagues&rsquo; findings concerning female farmers in some regions of Ondo State, Nigeria. The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplifies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specific types of crops in some regions. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%, respectively). Additionally, it doesn&rsquo;t effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don&rsquo;t make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly cultivate cereals, which doesn&rsquo;t address the value for that proportion and thus doesn&rsquo;t show that a majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating certain crops are female. </p>",

Indeed, the text suggests that these themes are timeless, as illustrated by the example of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, which the text states is still read and widely performed despite being set in the Italy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time. In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays. Because many theatergoers and readers are unlikely to possess such extensive historical knowledge, it follows that they are likely to find Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays less engaging than his more accessible tragedies. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text never introduces a comparison between Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies and twentieth-century plays, only between Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies and his history plays. Since twentieth-century plays aren&rsquo;t mentioned, there&rsquo;s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today&rsquo;s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>is thematically accessible to today&rsquo;s audiences, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is more accessible than Shakespeare&rsquo;s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies hold continued appeal for today&rsquo;s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare&rsquo;s other works. </p>",

The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way.

The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers&rsquo; claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that it&rsquo;s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; claim.

homeostatically regulated: animals compensate for periods of REM sleep deprivation by increasing subsequent REM sleep. When on land, fur seals get enough REM sleep, but during the weeks they\u2019re in the water, they get almost none. In a study of fur seals\u2019 sleep habits, researchers recorded the REM sleep (as a percentage of baseline) of fur seals once they had returned to land. They concluded that REM sleep may not be homeostatically regulated in fur seals, citing as evidence the fact that the seals in the study <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

The researchers concluded that as we approach maximum plausible surface temperatures, there will be a larger percentage of sites where thermal pollution could contribute to meeting home heating needs.

We do not know how many sites could have all (i.e., 100%) of their local heating needs met by thermal pollution, as the graph only classifies sites by whether \"0%,\" \"Up to 25%,\" and \"More than 25%\" of heating needs could be met. Choice B is incorrect. The graph is not depicting need for supplemental heating from thermal pollution, but rather potential to use thermal pollution for supplemental heating. Choice C is incorrect.

climate create thermal pollution (excess heat) in the shallow subsurface soil. Susanne A. Benz and colleagues analyzed thousands of sites on three continents under one scenario in which surface temperature remains at the current level and under another in which the surface reaches the maximum plausible temperature. They then categorized each site according to the percentage of local home heating needs that could be met using this excess subsurface heat. The team concluded that if surface temperature approaches the maximum plausible level, the percentage of sites where thermal pollution could feasibly contribute to meeting home heating needs will increase.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that there is a growing interest among CEOs in connecting with more departments in their companies. The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991&ndash;1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996&ndash;2001 period it was four, and during the 2001&ndash;2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991&ndash;1995 and 2001&ndash;2008 periods; thus, it isn&rsquo;t true that the average numbers didn&rsquo;t fluctuate. Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001&ndash;2008 period, not in the 1996&ndash;2001 period. Choice C is incorrect. Although it correctly describes a feature of the graph, the observation that more department leaders than managers are reporting to CEOs does not by itself address the question of whether CEOs are connecting with more departments over time&mdash;to address that question, one needs to know whether the number of department leaders reporting to CEOs is increasing over time. </p>",

The text indicates that &ldquo;until recently,&rdquo; superfluorescence (intense, synchronized bursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently, Biliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using &ldquo;thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,&rdquo; which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons.

Choice C is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than suggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room temperature in the absence of polarons.

Choice D is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed.

The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (<em>P.</em> <em>miniata</em>) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star&rsquo;s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active.

Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as \"known\") and doesn&rsquo;t address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars&rsquo; origin, Formery et al.&rsquo;s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is \"headless.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about <em>P. miniata</em> sea stars&rsquo; body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between <em>P. miniata </em>and <em>S. kowalevskii </em>acorn worms.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal regarding factors that affect urban land expansion (ULE). According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions&rsquo; relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal suggests that Region 1&rsquo;s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period. Thus, whereas the data suggest governments in Region 2 became more efficient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those governments became less efficient, not more.</p>",

The text discusses Fiorelli and colleagues&rsquo; discovery of egg clutches, single eggs, and eggshells in a Brazilian mine. According to the text, the presence of these eggs, which are from the Late Cretaceous period, led the researchers to conclude that the location was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs. The text then explains that the finding is important because of the &ldquo;previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.&rdquo; If there haven&rsquo;t been any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America&rsquo;s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the first, then the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it&rsquo;s the first nesting site found in northern regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention in the text about any difficulties that Fiorelli and colleagues faced when they were excavating the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine was occupied by sauropods other than titanosaurs.

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms&rsquo; limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student&rsquo;s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn&rsquo;t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China&rsquo;s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn&rsquo;t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms&rsquo; assets&mdash;and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports&mdash;were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn&rsquo;t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn&rsquo;t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.</p>",

The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.</p>",

The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn&rsquo;t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don&rsquo;t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn&rsquo;t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren&rsquo;t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have marketplaces, it wouldn&rsquo;t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don&rsquo;t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn&rsquo;t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn&rsquo;t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products. </p>",

The text begins by describing difrasismo, a device used in Classical Nahuatl poetry. The text then mentions the device&rsquo;s two functions: a formal one (giving structure to lines of verse) and a ritualistic one. The text indicates that the relation between the words in a difrasismo may appear tenuous without the additional information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture but that the meaning becomes intelligible in the context of that information. Therefore, the difrasismo&rsquo;s apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the two nouns used in a difrasismo are semantically equivalent; instead, the text indicates that the two nouns used in a difrasismo make up a single metaphor whose meaning is often intelligible only in the context of information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that there&rsquo;s a relationship between the formal function of the difrasismo and the difrasismo&rsquo;s intelligibility. Additionally, the text suggests that present-day readers who are familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture wouldn&rsquo;t find the difrasismo to be unintelligible. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the frequency of difrasismo&rsquo;s use in Classical Nahuatl is a necessary feature of intelligibility: the text indicates that an infrequently used difrasismo would presumably also be intelligible to members of an Aztec audience who are sufficiently familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of <em>A. mexicanus</em>. According to the text, <em>A. mexicanus</em>, a river-dwelling fish species, has colonized caves. The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason. In context, this observation suggests that even though the fish are a single species right now, they could be in the process of splitting into distinct populations with different characteristics.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text suggesting that the river fish are less reliant on sonic communication than the cave fish are. Although the text does indicate that the river fish and cave fish are genetically similar, the text describes both groups as using sonic communication and says nothing to indicate that one group depends on that communication more than the other group does. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that all members of the species can emit the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds differ depending on whether the fish live in rivers or caves, but it does not indicate that river fish produce sounds that cave fish do not or vice versa.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the text. The text says that there is little genetic difference between the river fish and the cave fish, not that the river fish and cave fish are so genetically distinct that they can be considered separate species. </p>",

The text explains that early in Earth&rsquo;s history, Earth exhibited a stagnant lid regime in which there&rsquo;s no interaction between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. The text further explains that, by contrast, once Earth began to exhibit a tectonic plate regime, its lithospheric and mantle material began to mix. If mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain material not found in older mantle-derived rocks, that material must have originated somewhere other than the mantle.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of <em>Instant Mural</em>. According to the text, the 1974 work <em>Instant Mural</em> involved taping two Asco members (Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval) to an outdoor wall as a direct commentary on constraint (limitation or restriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on Valdez&rsquo;s role in the work and on social limitations women faced at the time&mdash;an approach that fails to explain the role of Sandoval, a man&mdash;people should consider that in 1974 (and long before) the art establishment limited recognition of Chicano artists to those who created murals with social and historical subjects, making it challenging for nonmuralist Chicano artists (such as Asco&rsquo;s members) to show their work. The text suggests that considering the situation with the art establishment leads to a conclusion that accounts for the fact that <em>Instant Mural</em> is explicitly about constraint and features both a woman and a man taped to the wall: <em>Instant Mural</em> isn&rsquo;t a reflection of the social constraints placed on women specifically but instead is a reflection on the constraining aesthetic expectations placed on Chicano artists in general (that is, the limits resulting from the lack of recognition of Chicano artists of any gender who did not create sociohistorical murals).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that the art establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did recognize Chicano muralists to the exclusion of other Chicano artists, so there&rsquo;s no reason to assume Asco&rsquo;s work <em>Instant Mural</em> was intended to represent Chicano muralists&rsquo; frustration; it&rsquo;s far more likely that Asco&rsquo;s members&mdash;described as Chicano nonmuralists&mdash;were representing their own frustration at being unrecognized by the art establishment. Choice B is incorrect. The text emphasizes that while a common approach to <em>Instant Mural</em> focuses on Valdez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails to account for the presence of a man in the work, there is a conclusion that explains Sandoval&rsquo;s role. But concluding that <em>Instant Mural</em> represents a double constraint experienced specifically by female Chicano artists would still fail to account for the inclusion of a man in the work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that <em>Instant Mural</em> can be understood as something other than a commentary on social constraints women faced in 1974, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the work is best understood as a critique of the content of any other artworks. The text doesn&rsquo;t address how Chicano culture is depicted in sociohistorical murals; it discusses such murals only to make the point that in 1974 (and earlier) the art establishment recognized Chicano artists who produced them to the exclusion of Chicano nonmuralists, indicating a constraint all of Asco&rsquo;s members faced, regardless of gender.</p>",

The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this finding would directly support the scholars&rsquo; claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this finding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the finding wouldn&rsquo;t directly support the scholars&rsquo; claim that the majority of the game&rsquo;s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this finding doesn&rsquo;t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars&rsquo; claim about the board game. Choice D is incorrect because this finding doesn&rsquo;t mention the board game at all, referring only to the remains of other goods found at the site in Oman, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars&rsquo; claim about the board game. </p>",

This choice describes a time period when the rate of change differed between countries, suggesting that country-specific factors may have played a role in these changes. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. The median age of first marriage was consistently higher for men than for women in the United States during the time period depicted. Choice C is incorrect. The student concluded that country-specific factors influence changes to median age of first marriage. However, this choice doesn&rsquo;t provide any contrasts between countries and thus doesn&rsquo;t support the idea of country-specific factors influencing median age of first marriage. Choice D is incorrect. The students&rsquo; conclusion is about changes that occurred during the 20th century.

countries throughout the twentieth century. The author of the essay cites factors common to these countries that the author believes caused an increase in the median age of first marriage, such as new technologies that shortened the time needed for domestic chores, making two-person households less necessary and living alone more viable. The student asserts that beyond these factors there must be additional ones specific to particular Western countries that influenced the increase of age at first marriage.</p>",

Furthermore, those infected receive special treatment, ceasing their share of labor to sustain the colony and remaining in the nest as uninfected workers feed, groom, and transport them.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, <em>A. brevis</em>, and its host insect, the <em>T. nylanderi</em> ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants&rsquo; share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study&rsquo;s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how <em>A. brevis</em> is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to <em>A. brevis</em> while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies.</p>",

The researchers predicted that the students&rsquo; positive early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them to be more likely to later share the language with younger generations.

To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant&rsquo;s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows&rsquo; health overall.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there&rsquo;s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don&rsquo;t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn&rsquo;t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn&rsquo;t weaken Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn&rsquo;t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn&rsquo;t undermine Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn&rsquo;t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster&rsquo;s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.</p>",

Difference in cell size results in a construction problem&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells&mdash;that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student&rsquo;s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn&rsquo;t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn&rsquo;t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a <em>higher </em>percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.</p>",

In response to a rapidly dwindling population of blueback salmon, the Quinault Indian Nation (a tribe in Washington State) partnered with the conservation organization Wild Salmon Center to restore naturally occurring logjams in the Quinault River. The logjams create shady pools where the blueback salmon can rest and spawn, thus promoting blueback population recovery.</p>",

The text indicates that in many cases where conservationists are trying to protect ecosystems, their methods depend on natural processes or features. The text then gives an example of this phenomenon, a project with the Quinault Indian Nation that allowed logjams to form naturally in a river, creating spawning habitats for blueback salmon.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does suggest that the partnership with the Quinault Indian Nation was beneficial, this is not the central aim of the text; the text primarily argues that nature-based approaches to conservation can be effective. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that logjams are helpful to blueback salmon, the example of the blueback salmon project is included to illustrate the larger point made earlier in the text: that nature-based approaches to conservation are often effective. Choice D is incorrect. There is no evidence in the text to support a direct comparison of the efficacy of nature-based conservation approaches to other types of approaches. The text merely indicates that nature-based approaches can often be effective.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in <em>L. pertusa</em> coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph&rsquo;s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em>. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of <em>L. pertusa</em> declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the <em>L. pertusa</em> population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the <em>L. pertusa</em> decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral&rsquo;s decline near the Mauritanian coast.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in <em>L. pertusa</em> (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral&rsquo;s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral&rsquo;s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in <em>L. pertusa</em> than after&mdash;because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after&mdash;the graph doesn&rsquo;t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral&rsquo;s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em>. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn&rsquo;t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em> in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza&rsquo;s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn&rsquo;t move linearly, going \"on and on, from one thing to the next,\" but instead moves circularly, \"like the hands of a clock.\" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day \"following the same path.\" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly \"disturbed [Karenin&rsquo;s] sense of time,\" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin&rsquo;s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin&rsquo;s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin&rsquo;s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs&rsquo; circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be \"plotted on a straight line.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"&mdash;that is, always in a regular and predictable way.</p>",

The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species&rsquo; level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water&rsquo;s tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules&rsquo; tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water&rsquo;s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water&rsquo;s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.</p>",

If Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes&rsquo;s argument, since it would suggest that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes&rsquo;s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes&rsquo;s argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes&rsquo;s argument that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, since Paredes argued that Mexican-American folklore is the product of various cultures interacting in Mexico and the United States, he would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because scholars&rsquo; previous ignorance of the folklore would have no bearing on Paredes&rsquo;s argument that Mexican-American folklore mostly reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. The folklore&rsquo;s origins are independent of scholars&rsquo; knowledge of the folklore.&nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells. The text explains that perovskite solar cells&rsquo; efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor&rsquo;s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor&rsquo;s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about spray coating&rsquo;s potential value. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn&rsquo;t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating. </p>",

light into electricity more efficiently than earlier kinds of solar cells, and manufacturing advances have recently made them commercially attractive. One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. Andr\u00e9 Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells.</p>",

In recent decades, tadpoles in the Australian population have been shown to consume eggs of their own species. A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians. However, using data from this study, a student wishes to argue that the presence of bufadienolide doesn&rsquo;t entirely explain the cane toad tadpoles&rsquo; preference for certain eggs over others.</p>",

The text indicates that, according to Purcell&rsquo;s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual&rsquo;s actions in relation to that individual&rsquo;s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur.

Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action&rsquo;s effects and the individual&rsquo;s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text&rsquo;s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual&rsquo;s action is dependent on the action&rsquo;s effects on the community and the person&rsquo;s specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors&mdash;the other being the person&rsquo;s societal role&mdash;that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles.</p>",

The table presents the average time pollinators spent per floral morph.

By contrast, for thrum flowers, the difference in time spent on intact and damaged flowers is seen for only some pollinator genera.

As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren&rsquo;t considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that it wasn&rsquo;t possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd&rsquo;a&scaron;tart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins&rsquo; weight.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon&rsquo;s financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised&mdash;that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade&mdash;likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it&rsquo;s unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren&rsquo;t considered suitable for trade, so Abd&rsquo;a&scaron;tart I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it&rsquo;s unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency.</p>",

The text explains that the LNH holds that there is an inverse relationship between the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity) and the grammatical complexity of that language&mdash;that is, that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity decreases, and vice versa. According to the text, Shcherbakova and colleagues focused on two positive indications of grammatical complexity&mdash;fusion and informativity&mdash;and analyzed their occurrence in over 1,300 languages. If the researchers found a slightly positive correlation between fusion and exotericity and between informativity and exotericity&mdash;meaning that to some extent, grammatical complexity increases as the number of non-native speakers of a language increases&mdash;their outcome would not be consistent with the assumption that exotericity and grammatical complexity are inversely related (the LNH).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to say that a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and both fusion and informativity is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH, since the finding would address only grammatical complexity (given that fusion and informativity are aspects of grammatical complexity) and wouldn&rsquo;t move beyond that factor to address its relationship to the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity), which is the relationship the LNH focuses on. Choice B is incorrect because a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity)&mdash;meaning that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity somewhat decreases, and vice versa&mdash;would be consistent, not inconsistent, with the LNH, since the text indicates that according to the LNH, there is an inverse relationship between grammatical complexity and exotericity; a negative correlation reflects an inverse relationship.

The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH<sub>3</sub> without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH<sub>3</sub> serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH<sub>3</sub> in the absence of biological activity.

Sarah Gravem and colleagues placed sunflower sea stars, a once-abundant predator species suffering massive population declines in recent years, in aquariums that each contained a nutritionally poor and a nutritionally rich purple sea urchin.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of the researchers&rsquo; findings about purple sea urchins and sunflower sea stars. The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn&rsquo;t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones. It doesn&rsquo;t suggest that sunflower sea stars generally prefer other marine animals that are more nutritious; there&rsquo;s no mention of other marine animals. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that sunflower sea stars are generally reluctant to feed on sea urchins. In fact, the text indicates that the sunflower sea stars in the study did consume sea urchins, feeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only the willingness of sunflower sea stars to consume the type of sea urchins found in barrens (nutritionally poor sea urchins), not how likely other species of sea stars are to consume them.</p>",

The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn&rsquo;t initially plan to write a story only &ldquo;focusing on the meeting itself&rdquo; but rather had considered writing a &ldquo;much longer&rdquo; and more expansive work about the meeting&rsquo;s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film&rsquo;s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn&rsquo;t specify to what extent Powers&rsquo;s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened. Rather, the quotation focuses on Powers&rsquo;s description of the film&rsquo;s basic premise and how the characters engage with the historical context of its setting. </p>",

The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru&rsquo;s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth&rsquo;s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; claim.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, not strengthen it.

According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them&mdash;that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000&ndash;57,000 newtons and 35,000&ndash;63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000&ndash;235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000&ndash;34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn&rsquo;t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson&rsquo;s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can&rsquo;t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don&rsquo;t support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates. </p>",

The text states that linguists first observed <em>meng</em>- being used as an onomatopoeic tag on social media, which then spread to being affixed to existing words in text posted on social media; from there, it has begun to move into spoken Bahasa Indonesia. As presented in the text, this progression from online usage to spoken language suggests that social media does more than just register or reflect changes in language&mdash;it can actively drive such changes. In the case of <em>meng</em>-, the text suggests, social media facilitated the movement of the affix from an online tag to part of spoken Bahasa Indonesia.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t differentiate between social media&rsquo;s usefulness for studying informal versus formal or official language; it merely notes that Bahasa Indonesia is an official language. Choice B is incorrect because while the example given in the text focuses on changes in Bahasa Indonesia, the text doesn&rsquo;t provide any evidence that social media is exerting an exceptionally strong influence on the evolution of this particular language compared to others. In fact, the text states that \"linguists have noted many similar examples of this phenomenon occurring in other languages,\" suggesting that social media&rsquo;s influence is evident across multiple languages and not unique to Bahasa Indonesia. Choice C is incorrect because the text never suggests that social media provides a somewhat misleading sense of how languages are changing. Rather, the text suggests that by allowing linguists to directly observe linguistic changes, social media offers a clear window into language evolution.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Uto-Aztecan languages. The text explains that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family descended from a single language (believed to have originated in what is now the US Southwest), resulting in similarities across the family&rsquo;s languages; however, the branches don&rsquo;t have similar vocabulary for maize, even though maize has been cultivated by all Uto-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest&mdash;the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family&rsquo;s origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize. If maize arrived after the division occurred, however, the tribes in the two regions likely would have developed vocabulary pertaining to maize separately, at the times when they acquired the crop.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to how some Uto-Aztecan tribes obtained maize wouldn&rsquo;t directly address the role of language. Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don&rsquo;t have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch&mdash;that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to the timing and source of maize acquisition wouldn&rsquo;t directly address the role of language. Furthermore, the text implies that southern Uto-Aztecan tribes probably acquired maize before the northern tribes did, given the evidence that maize originated in Mexico&mdash;the location of the best-known representative of the southern branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family&mdash;before spreading to the north.</p>",

The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants&rsquo; own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants&rsquo; ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates&rsquo; likability ratings (as participants&rsquo; ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates&rsquo; likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates&rsquo; likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants&rsquo; ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion. The conclusion isn&rsquo;t just that participants gave different ratings to the two types of candidates&mdash;it&rsquo;s that participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores specifically gave higher likability ratings to admirable-trait candidates than to ignoble-trait candidates and that participants with high ignobility scores didn&rsquo;t.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that economist Adam Smith&rsquo;s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term \"putatively,\" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn&rsquo;t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing \"putatively,\" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor&rsquo;s use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor&rsquo;s importance to Smith&rsquo;s work.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith&rsquo;s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith&rsquo;s metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text&rsquo;s emphasis on Smith&rsquo;s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith&rsquo;s metaphor, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the metaphor is a \"useful model\" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals&rsquo; selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith&rsquo;s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith&rsquo;s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis about the plants&rsquo; dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage&mdash;such as access to phosphorus&mdash;from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don&rsquo;t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don&rsquo;t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn&rsquo;t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There&rsquo;s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn&rsquo;t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.</p>",

The text also indicates that around the same time, the sites began to contain glass beads and other artifacts seeming to be from the Near East, even though there is no evidence that the people of those sites traveled widely outside Siberia. Because there is evidence of Near East dog breeds and Near East artifacts at Siberian sites beginning about 2,000 years ago but no evidence of the people&rsquo;s travel to the Near East around that time, it&rsquo;s reasonable to infer that Feuerborn and colleagues concluded that dogs and artifacts like glass beads were transported to Siberia from the Near East, starting around 2,000 years ago.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text explicitly states that there is no evidence that the people of the Siberian sites 2,000 years ago traveled extensively beyond Siberia, which they would&rsquo;ve had to do to reach the Near East; therefore, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to conclude that the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads suggests that people from Siberia began arriving in the Near East around 2,000 years ago.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah&rsquo;s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic&mdash;namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average&mdash;which implies faster travel times between package destinations&mdash;would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections&mdash;both with and without dedicated left-turn signals&mdash;would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn&rsquo;t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher&rsquo;s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times.</p>",

The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestral Puebloan civilization abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa Verde site. The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried their agricultural practices&mdash;including the farming of turkeys&mdash;to their new home. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text never compares the condition of the Rio Grande Valley&rsquo;s terrain to that of Mesa Verde&rsquo;s terrain, either in the present or in the past. Choice C is incorrect.

Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn&rsquo;t consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region&mdash;the Rio Grande Valley&mdash;after 1280. </p>",

The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language.

According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country&rsquo;s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount.

Although Kenya&rsquo;s total population can be inferred from the table&mdash;if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people&mdash;nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya&rsquo;s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn&rsquo;t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili.

The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces.

The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues&rsquo; experiment, which showed that <em>Testudo</em> tortoises, which aren&rsquo;t social and don&rsquo;t practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn&rsquo;t social and doesn&rsquo;t practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn&rsquo;t be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don&rsquo;t practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and face-like stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can&rsquo;t show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren&rsquo;t social and don&rsquo;t practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided.

can enable sellers to capitalize on the heterogeneous values consumers assign to the same goods and services, but doing so requires careful messaging. Annie Peng Cui and Jennifer Wiggins recruited 171 participants (ages 18&ndash;60) online for an initial study and 83 students (ages 18&ndash;31) at a state university for a second study to test the effect of three different messages&mdash;&ldquo;pay what you can,&rdquo; &ldquo;pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo;&mdash;on how much participants would pay for concert tickets. Their results illustrate both the heterogeneity of consumer valuations and how sellers can benefit by prompting consumers to consider their own valuations: <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text about the effect of messaging on participative pricing. The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition than they do under both the \"pay what you can\" and the \"pay what you want\" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a finding that supports the idea that sellers can benefit when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the \"pay what you can\" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn&rsquo;t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it&rsquo;s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants&rsquo; valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets&rsquo; actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study.</p>",

One of the oldest examples, the Fairfield Gorget, was found in Fairfield, Missouri, in 1958. Its overall design resembles that of other art from the region during the Mississippian period (900&ndash;1600 CE). Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar&mdash;a species whose range doesn&rsquo;t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species&rsquo; range.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the underlined explanation that the jaguar imagery on the Fairfield Gorget could have been inspired by art objects brought to Missouri from Mexico. The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it&rsquo;s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar&rsquo;s range didn&rsquo;t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget&rsquo;s artist likely wouldn&rsquo;t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar&rsquo;s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget&rsquo;s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE. The actions of contemporary artists cannot provide evidence for centuries-old networks of artistic influence and exchange.</p>",

In a study addressing this relative inefficiency, a team led by Laura Miranda-P&eacute;rez demonstrated that the addition of a thin layer of the mineral perovskite&mdash;which captures the blue range of light in the solar spectrum, whereas silicon captures the red range&mdash;allows the cells to convert 29.5% or more of the Sun&rsquo;s energy into usable electricity.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the efficiency of various photovoltaic cells. The text indicates that Miranda-P&eacute;rez and her team found that adding a layer of perovskite to silicon-based cells increased the percentage of sunlight converted to usable electricity relative to the percentage converted to electricity by silicon-based cells. Using cells with only perovskite and no silicon, however, resulted in no improvement in efficiency over silicon-based cells. The text also states that perovskite captures light in the blue range of the solar spectrum and silicon captures light in the red range of the spectrum. If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater efficiency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved efficiency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%&ndash;22% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more efficient than silicon-based cells are. Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less&mdash;not more than 29.5%&mdash;of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the effect of combining perovskite and silicon and the different parts of the solar spectrum that perovskite and silicon capture.</p>",

Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Jan Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about the effect of leave time on the attentiveness of university employees. According to the text, the researchers&rsquo; study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave, and a group who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who\ntook no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave with those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers&rsquo; conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.</p>",

The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels.

Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn&rsquo;t sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. </p>",

Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots.</p>",

The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named &lsquo;Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from &lsquo;Oumuamua&rsquo;s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within &lsquo;Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: &lsquo;Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues&rsquo; claim.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from &lsquo;Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of &lsquo;Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: &lsquo;Oumuamua&rsquo;s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner&rsquo;s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to &lsquo;Oumuamua, but the text states that &lsquo;Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.</p>",

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice C is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth without adding nitrogen under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only the growth with and without nitrogen fertilization under moderate climate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it&rsquo;s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn&rsquo;t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn&rsquo;t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn&rsquo;t advantageous.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.&nbsp;</p>",

The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn&rsquo;t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other <em>E. coli</em> strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for <em>E. coli</em>, and similarity between strains (of <em>E. coli</em> or of other pathogens) isn&rsquo;t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of <em>E. coli</em>, since Somvanshi et al.&rsquo;s paper turned purple when exposed to <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn&rsquo;t bind to different strains of <em>E. coli</em>. The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of <em>E. coli</em> (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of <em>E. coli</em>. In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low.</p>",

While the text does state that scientists from many fields are researching artificial leaves, they&rsquo;re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that artificial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn&rsquo;t argue that this process is more efficient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and efficiency of these artificial leaves. Choice D is incorrect.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text based on supporting data in the graph. The text indicates that in the fly <em>D. melanogaster</em>, <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em> are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested <em>D. melanogaster</em>&rsquo;s resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> and <em>A. sicerae</em> bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: <em>DptA</em> silenced (referred to as type A), <em>DptB</em> silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> correlates with <em>DptA</em> activity but not with <em>DptB</em> activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to <em>P. rettgeri</em>). The graph shows the post&ndash;<em>A. sicerae</em> infection results, which indicate that <em>DptB</em> activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas <em>DptA</em> activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when <em>DptA</em> activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when <em>DptB</em> activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with <em>DptA</em> activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that <em>DptB</em> may have developed as a specific defense against <em>A. sicerae</em>.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that <em>DptA</em> activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where <em>DptA</em> alone was silenced, <em>DptB</em> alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em>, which would be necessary to determine whether <em>DptA </em>conferred defense against <em>A. sicerae</em> in the presence of<em> DptB</em>. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: <em>P. rettgeri</em> and <em>A. sicerae</em>. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in <em>DptA</em> is associated with resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> while <em>DptB</em> activity is not, and that <em>DptB</em> activity is associated with resistance to <em>A. sicerae</em> while <em>DptA</em> is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em>. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em> silenced, or inactive.</p>",

The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust, astronomers believe planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The finding that the amount of iron in some rocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weaken the astronomers&rsquo; claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star, but in higher quantities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a finding only about the makeup of stars, whether they&rsquo;ve cooled or not, would provide no information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t have any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about two host stars having similar proportions of certain materials wouldn&rsquo;t provide any information about the makeup of planets. Thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to the claim that planets and their host stars are composed of the same materials in differing quantities. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the astronomers&rsquo; claim is based on a fact&mdash;that stars and planets begin forming from the same gas and dust in space&mdash;which would remain true regardless of the effectiveness of a method for analysis of compositions. The text does cite analysis of rocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of evidence that is consistent with the claim and not as the source of the claim; the finding that the method used for that analysis is less effective in other scenarios wouldn&rsquo;t weaken a claim that&rsquo;s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the scholar&rsquo;s claim about Toni Morrison&rsquo;s likely goal of strengthening the presence of Black writers on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors. The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s&mdash;during most of Morrison&rsquo;s time working there&mdash;than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House&rsquo;s published authors, thus supporting the scholar&rsquo;s claim. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company&rsquo;s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison&rsquo;s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn&rsquo;t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison&rsquo;s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar&rsquo;s claim focuses on Morrison&rsquo;s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison&rsquo;s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House. </p>",

The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering.

The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don&rsquo;t sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers&rsquo; claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold&mdash;even if those profits are earned less frequently and don&rsquo;t support weekly loan payments.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn&rsquo;t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn&rsquo;t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors&mdash;meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn&rsquo;t depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn&rsquo;t affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the sediments found at the Gale Crater&rsquo;s Murray Formation on Mars. The text states that data gathered by the <em>Curiosity</em> rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars&rsquo;s surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hern&aacute;ndez et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) <em>was</em> present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from. Choice C is incorrect because the evidence described in the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that there were streams at the Murray Formation for an extended period and a lake for just a short time. The abundance of fine grains suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) was present for an extended time, not just a short time, and the sections of coarse grains suggest that one or more streams (bodies of flowing water) were intermittently present while the lake existed, not at a separate time. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but <em>did</em> occasionally dry out.</p>",
