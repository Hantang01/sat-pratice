The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years&mdash;1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees&mdash;grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.&nbsp;</p>",

The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn&rsquo;t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged.

The text begins by stating that the mating call of the male t&uacute;ngara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs&rsquo; blood. Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sufficient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion&mdash;that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers&rsquo; trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue. This finding supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers&rsquo; conclusion&mdash;that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of t&uacute;ngara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a finding that would contradict the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a finding contrary to the researchers&rsquo; conclusion.</p>",

The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author&rsquo;s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student&rsquo;s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because&nbsp;the student&rsquo;s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made.

study participants’ responses to three versions of the same negative review—a control review expressing no anger, a review expressing a high degree of anger, and a review expressing a low degree of anger. Reviewing the data, a student concludes that the mere presence of anger in a review may not negatively affect readers’ perceptions of the review, but a high degree of anger in a review does worsen readers’ perceptions of the review.</p>",

The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros&rsquo;s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character&rsquo;s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn&rsquo;t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren&rsquo;t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella&rsquo;s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren&rsquo;t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that <em>The House on Mango Street</em> has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn&rsquo;t relate directly to the text&rsquo;s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Stree</em>t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros&rsquo;s novella, such similarities wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how <em>The House on Mango Street</em> had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence.&nbsp;</p>",

The graph presents percentages of maize exported by Argentina, Brazil, and the United States in marketing years 2009/2010 to 2013/2014 and indicates that for the marketing year 2012/2013, the percentage of maize exported by Argentina decreased to about 70 percent from about 80 percent in the previous marketing year.

Moreover, the graph shows that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil remained higher, not lower, than the percentage exported by the United States in the marketing year 2012/2013. Choice B is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil never exceeded the percentage exported by Argentina for any of the marketing years represented. Choice D is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by the United States reached its lowest point, not its highest, during the five marketing years in 2012/2013, with the United States exporting only about 8 percent of its maize in that marketing year.</p>",

The claim is that some concentrations of H₂S led to increased germination rates, and this choice accurately shows that seeds treated with 10 micromoles per liter of H₂S tended to germinate faster than untreated seeds. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t justify the claim. The claim compares the germination rates of seeds exposed to certain concentrations of H₂S to untreated seeds, but this choice only discusses one concentration of H₂S, so it can&rsquo;t support any comparison between treated and untreated groups. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. At 168 hours, only about 85% of seeds treated with H₂S at 500 micromoles per liter and well over 70% of untreated seeds had germinated (about 80%). Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. At 48 hours, about 70% of seeds treated with H₂S at 10 micromoles per liter and about 50% of untreated seeds had germinated. </p>",

They treated bean, corn, wheat, and pea seeds with various concentrations (measured in micromoles per liter) of H₂S and tracked the germination of those seeds along with the germination of untreated seeds. Treatment with particular concentrations of H₂S was associated with accelerated germination: for example, <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support Gardner and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the Missouri River flowing into lakes tend to carry more sediment than do segments of the river flowing out of lakes. The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. Only a comparison of river segments flowing into lakes with segments flowing out of lakes can support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion.&nbsp;</p>",

artifacts dating to 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago have been recovered from the Evron Quarry in Israel. Likely created by the hominin <em>Homo erectus</em>, the artifacts have no visual features suggesting that they were exposed to fire, leading some scholars to conclude that these hominins had not acquired control of fire. But Zane Stepka and colleagues recently used a new method to determine whether these artifacts had been exposed to temperatures above 400°C (the typical temperature campfires reach) and concluded that the hominins who inhabited the site may have had control of fire. </p>",

Although the text states that the Black Pearl orchestra is based in Philadelphia, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that most of the music it plays was composed by Philadelphians. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does state that Johnson founded the Black Pearl orchestra, this is just a detail and not the main focus of the text.

However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things.

The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures&nbsp; shared by civilian government entities and the military. Hence, it&rsquo;s reasonable to infer that it&rsquo;s the familiarity of the structures of civilian government that makes jobs there particularly attractive to military veterans.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t address what a typical relationship between military service and later career preferences would be, and there&rsquo;s no indication that it&rsquo;s atypical for veterans to work in civilian government jobs after they&rsquo;ve left the military. On the contrary, the text suggests that many military veterans are drawn to such jobs. Choice C is incorrect because the text is focused on the high representation of military veterans in civilian government jobs and doesn&rsquo;t address nonveterans or their possible interest in military service.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys that military veterans may be particularly interested in civilian government jobs due to the familiarity of organizational structures that are already in place, but there&rsquo;s no reason to think that this interest would mean that more civilian government jobs will start to require military experience. </p>",

This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data in the graph supporting Ayalew and her colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis that plants&rsquo; response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals. The graph compares the metal content of two groups of plants, one with kanamycin exposure and a control group without such exposure. The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure. Choice C is incorrect. The graph shows that the zinc levels for the control plants (those without kanamycin exposure) were around 400 parts per million, not 300 parts per million, and that the zinc levels for plants with kanamycin exposure were around 300 parts per million, not 400 parts per million. </p>",

The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren&rsquo;t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue.

Choice C is incorrect because finding that some participants believed that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings would be irrelevant to the team&rsquo;s idea. The purple and blue wings were both noniridescent, so any difference in how easy those two colors were to see would have nothing to do with the idea that iridescent insects are harder to see than noniridescent insects. Choice D is incorrect because if some participants found all the wings, that wouldn&rsquo;t support the team&rsquo;s idea that iridescent insects may be harder to see than noniridescent insects.

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of <em>T.</em> <em>navigans</em> based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons&mdash;namely, that <em>T. navigans</em> had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of <em>T. navigans</em>, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that <em>T. navigans</em> had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make <em>T. navigans</em> different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, <em>T. navigans</em> likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that <em>T. navigans</em> would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that <em>T. navigans </em>had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.</p>",

The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain&rsquo;s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony&rsquo;s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can influence how a language develops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has stayed the same over time in some ways, not on how it has changed from one generation to the next.

Hui and colleagues found that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can encourage customers to make spontaneous purchases. The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items&rsquo; new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll make an unplanned purchase. This quotation from a surveyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously purchased a notebook while looking for cleaning supplies that weren&rsquo;t in their usual place. The quotation therefore supports the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn&rsquo;t find some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to coupons that the shopper received, not to a new store layout. Thus, the quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn&rsquo;t carry those products, so the quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases.</p>",

Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics&rsquo; concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale&rsquo;s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.</p>",

Although this quotation refers to several flowers (primroses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speaker is in a \"bower,\" or shady spot among the trees&mdash;details which suggest that the speaker is experiencing the sights of spring&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the speaker is having contradictory feelings, only that the speaker believes that the flowers are experiencing enjoyment.

Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring&mdash;namely, new leaves on nearby trees appear to be opening up (\"The budding twigs spread out their fan\") to feel the breeze&mdash;the quotation doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the speaker feels conflicted about this: the statement \"And I must think, do all I can\" suggests the speaker&rsquo;s determination to attribute feelings of pleasure to the trees, not that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation indicates that the speaker isn&rsquo;t certain what the birds are thinking (\"Their thoughts I cannot measure\"), there&rsquo;s nothing to suggest that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings.

Although Europa lacks liquid surface water, the same process could be driven by the moon&rsquo;s subsurface ocean.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter&rsquo;s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland&rsquo;s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa&rsquo;s surface. In other words, the main idea of the text is that parallel ridges in the ice on Europa and Greenland are likely caused by similar processes even though in Greenland the process begins with liquid water on the surface while Europa lacks liquid water on the surface.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text states outright that the ridges on Europa are parallel and furthermore refers to Greenland&rsquo;s ridges as \"strikingly similar\" to those on Europa. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of when any of the ice ridges formed, either separately or relative to one another. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate any uncertainty about the reason for the ice ridges on Europa and, in fact, clearly states that researchers now claim to know the mechanism that created the ridges.</p>",

For each of three years, the table presents four book genres and the percentage of total sales for each genre in e-book format. Cookbooks, a nonfiction genre, do not require the reader to read straight through. According to the table, 10.5 percent of total cookbook sales in 2016 were in the e-book format. The 2016 percentage of e-book sales was 36.7 percent in the science fiction and fantasy genre, which are typically stories read straight through from start to finish. The higher percentage of total sales of the story-based e-books in 2016 supports the claim in the text. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it compares the e-book sales of romance books in 2006 to those in 2016. Romance books are meant to be read straight through from start to finish. The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are not as commercially successful in e-book format as those that do. As this choice is only comparing e-book sales for one genre, it does not support the claim.

The table shows the annual spending by international tourists (which indicates annual international tourism revenue) in 2016&ndash;2018 in four Asian countries. According to the table, annual spending by international tourists in South Korea was $21.0 billion in 2016 and then decreased to $17.2 billion in 2017. This decrease shows that not all of the countries included in the table saw increases in annual international tourism revenue in 2017.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn&rsquo;t provide any data regarding revenue from tourism by residents of those countries. Even if that data were provided, it wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to the claim that the trend of annual increases in international tourism revenue in 2017 and 2018 was not universal. Choice B is incorrect because the data in the table do not support the statement that Japan&rsquo;s international tourism revenue was higher in 2016 than it was in 2018: the table indicates that Japan&rsquo;s annual international tourism revenue was $33.5 billion in 2016, which is less than Japan&rsquo;s annual international tourism revenue of $45.3 billion in 2018. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that Thailand&rsquo;s revenue from international tourism was higher than that of the other three Asian countries in 2016, 2017, and 2018, this information has no direct bearing on the text&rsquo;s claim that not all the Asian countries represented in the table saw an increase in revenue from international tourism.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Rodriguez and colleagues&rsquo; assertion about the classifications of the five new gas exoplanets. The text describes two categories of gas planets: hot Jupiters, which have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, and warm Jupiters, which have the same mass characteristic but have orbital periods of more than 10 days. According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days. These data therefore support Rodriguez and colleagues&rsquo; assertion that four of the new exoplanets are hot Jupiters and one is a warm Jupiter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table shows that TOI-628 b has a mass equivalent to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that one of the planets&mdash;TOI-1478 b&mdash;does indeed have an orbital period of more than 10 days. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe the data from the table. Although the table does show that the masses of the five planets range from 0.85 to 6.33 Jupiters, the table also shows that TOI-1478 b has an orbital period of 10.180 days, not 153 days. Choice C is incorrect. According to the table, TOI-1333 b has an orbital period of only 4.720 days, not more than 10 days. Additionally, although the table does show that all the planets have a radius between 1.060 and 1.771 Jupiters, the text indicates that a planet may be classified as a hot Jupiter or a warm Jupiter based on its mass and orbital period, not on its radius, making the information about the range of the five planets&rsquo; radius values irrelevant. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the graph to effectively support Charles and Stephens&rsquo;s claim about how level of information affects voters. The graph shows the probability of voting for both high- and low-information voters in seven categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that &ldquo;the more informed voters are about politics&hellip;the more likely they are to vote.&rdquo; This statement correctly asserts that the graph shows a higher probability of voting for high-information voters than for low-information voters at each of the seven political orientations. Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens&rsquo;s claim about how level of information affects voters. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph. Furthermore, even if we did have this information, the claim is about how level of information affects voters&rsquo; probability of voting, not whether they&rsquo;re likely to strongly identify with a particular political party. </p>",

Using survey data that revealed whether respondents voted in national elections and how knowledgeable respondents are about politics, Charles and Stephens claim that the likelihood of voting is driven in part by potential voters’ confidence in their assessments of candidates—essentially, the more informed voters are about politics, the more confident they are at evaluating whether candidates share their views, and thus the more likely they are to vote. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of parthenogenesis as it relates to two California condors at the San Diego Zoo. The text explains that parthenogenesis is a form of reproduction in which a female reproduces without mating, producing an egg containing an offspring with DNA that comes entirely from its mother. After noting examples of parthenogenesis among birds, the text then reports on a discovery at the San Diego Zoo. According to the text, scientists at the zoo found that two of the zoo&rsquo;s California condors weren&rsquo;t similar enough to any of the zoo&rsquo;s male condors to be their offspring. Given that parthenogenesis occurs without mating and results in an offspring with DNA entirely from its mother, it can reasonably be inferred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors probably didn&rsquo;t mate with any of the male condors at the zoo, reproducing through parthenogenesis instead.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that at least one of the condors&rsquo; mothers was born as a result of parthenogenesis. Rather, the text suggests that the two condors were themselves both probably born as a result of parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of strong genetic resemblance to any of the male condors in the zoo&rsquo;s condor enclosure. Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San Diego Zoo. For this reason, the text doesn&rsquo;t support a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors reproduce in zoos and how they reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that the zoo&rsquo;s female condors lacked sufficient access to males or that this would be a cause of parthenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosure included males.</p>",

The text begins by stating that the simulations led the researchers to conclude that the solar system likely formed from three giant dust rings that encircled the Sun. The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring&mdash;that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth&rsquo;s real size, it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring&rsquo;s formation was important in determining Earth&rsquo;s eventual size.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains that when the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring in one simulation, the size of the innermost planets was affected (which suggests that the middle ring likely formed earlier than it did in this simulation), the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that this was an initial simulation&mdash;that is, a simulation that was conducted before other simulations. Moreover, the text makes no reference to the specific results of any other simulations; therefore, there is no basis for comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring&rsquo;s formation was delayed with conclusions based on other simulations. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not the outermost ring, affected the four innermost planets&rsquo; eventual size in the researchers&rsquo; simulation; therefore, the simulation offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring&rsquo;s formation affected the size of the planets. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the innermost ring produced all the solar system&rsquo;s planets. Rather, the text states that the simulations showed that the innermost planets formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. &nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their hypothesis about workplace leaders and humility was correct. According to the text, Jia Hu and colleagues \"hypothesized that workplace leaders who reflect on lessons learned from past mistakes are likely to exhibit more humility than leaders who don&rsquo;t engage in such reflection.\" The bar graph shows the humility scores for managers who participated in Jia Hu and colleagues&rsquo; study. It shows average humility scores for managers who reflected on a past mistake that they learned from, managers who reflected on a past mistake that they didn&rsquo;t learn from, and managers who were in the control group that, according to the text, simply reflected on their daily routines. The graph shows that managers who reflected on a past mistake they learned from received an average humility score between 3.0 and 3.5. Both the control group and managers who reflected on a mistake they didn&rsquo;t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reflected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it&rsquo;s true that none of the group&rsquo;s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups&rsquo; average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn&rsquo;t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reflected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reflected on a mistake they didn&rsquo;t learn from. Furthermore, the idea that the managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups did would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the graph that all three groups of participants exhibited less humility on average than the researchers expected. The graph and text don&rsquo;t cite any specific expectations that the researchers had with regard to the humility scores for each group.</p>",

The graph shows that in 2010, the number of computer services jobs was approximately 6,000, which is the same approximate number of jobs in engineering services. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of jobs in technical consulting services and the number of jobs in computer services were about the same, at approximately 5,000.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the graph shows that in 2010 the number of computer services jobs (about 6,000) was higher than the number of  technical consulting services jobs (about 4,000), in 2019 the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not about the same as the number of engineering services jobs (about 6,000). Choice C is incorrect because according to the graph, the number of jobs in computer services was lower than the number of jobs in engineering services in 2019, not 2010. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not higher than the number of jobs in engineering services (about 6,000). Choice D is incorrect because the graph shows that the number of computer services jobs was about the same as the number of technical consulting services jobs in 2019, not 2010. This also means the number of computer services jobs could not have been lower than the technical consulting services jobs in 2019 if they were about the same.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017&ndash;2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes data in the bar graph&mdash;in 2018, the control-group yield is greater than 30 pounds per acre, and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is less than 30 pounds per acre&mdash;a claim that the control-group yield exceeds that of the nitrogen group strongly conflicts with the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that nitrogen fertilizer produces larger yields. Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.&nbsp;</p>",

According to the text, some scientists believe that a comet fragment hitting Earth caused the cooling of the Younger Dryas period to come about. The text then indicates that a team of scientists found a crater in Greenland, which some believe supports the theory of a comet fragment hitting Earth to initiate the Younger Dryas. However, the text also notes that the team was unable to determine the age of the crater. If the age of the crater can&rsquo;t be determined, then its connection to the Younger Dryas period of time can&rsquo;t be confirmed either. Thus, it can&rsquo;t be concluded that the impact that made the crater was connected to the beginning of the Younger Dryas.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because though the text suggests that the age of the comet crater found by a team of scientists is uncertain, it doesn&rsquo;t address whether a comet fragment can make a crater as large as 19 miles wide. The text doesn&rsquo;t consider the size of comet fragments and how they relate to the size of craters they might make. Choice C is incorrect because the debate in the text centers on the age of the crater found, not the cause of the crater. The text doesn&rsquo;t indicate uncertainty about what caused the discovered crater. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that the age of the crater found by the team of scientists is uncertain, not that the dates of the Younger Dryas are uncertain or incorrect. The text states that \"the Younger Dryas was a period of extreme cooling from 11,700 to 12,900 years ago\" but doesn&rsquo;t indicate any debate about the timing of the period.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of mosquito repellents. The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes&rsquo; antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team&rsquo;s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes&rsquo; antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists&rsquo; claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program&rsquo;s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists&rsquo; claim about the program&rsquo;s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program&rsquo;s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well.</p>",

The text makes this claim based on the fact that ancient trade routes connected Puerto Rico with Colombia but not with Peru. However, if it&rsquo;s true that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were genetically less similar to ancient guinea pigs in Colombia than to ancient guinea pigs in Peru, this would suggest that the Puerto Rican guinea pigs didn&rsquo;t descend from Colombian guinea pigs. Instead, Puerto Rican guinea pigs&rsquo; greater genetic similarity to Peruvian guinea pigs implies that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were likely brought to the island from Peru, despite the lack of direct ancient trade routes between the two regions.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While a finding about how common guinea pig imagery is in ancient Puerto Rican art would indicate the cultural significance of guinea pigs, it wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to a claim about the geographical origin or descent of the guinea pig population on the island. The guinea pigs depicted in the artwork could have descended from guinea pigs in either Colombia or Peru; therefore, the finding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that guinea pigs in Puerto Rico probably came from Colombia and descended from Colombian guinea pigs. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that modern breeds of guinea pigs don&rsquo;t look like images of guinea pigs in ancient art from Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Peru wouldn&rsquo;t address the ancestral relationships between ancient guinea pig populations in these three regions. Therefore, the finding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that guinea pigs in Puerto Rico probably came from Colombia and descended from Colombian guinea pigs. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about the population sizes of guinea pigs in ancient Colombia and ancient Peru wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to a claim about which population the Puerto Rican guinea pigs likely descended from. The smaller guinea pig population of Peru could still have been the source for the Puerto Rican guinea pig population.</p>",

The text explains that one group of scientists thinks the tusk may help narwhals detect the threat of freezing water and that Laidre disagrees with that idea, given the importance of avoiding a dangerous situation. It&rsquo;s logical to suggest that if the tusk serves such an important purpose for narwhals, the trait would be more common among them&mdash;specifically, that more narwhals would have a tusk.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no reason to think Laidre would say that if the tusk has the important function of helping narwhals detect when the water around them is about to freeze (meaning that it isn&rsquo;t always freezing), some narwhals would choose a different habitat altogether. Indeed, if it&rsquo;s true that the tusk helps narwhals avoid areas with dangerous conditions when they occur in their Arctic Ocean habitat, the tusk would likely enable the narwhals to continue living in that habitat rather than drive them elsewhere entirely. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on narwhals and makes no mention of other marine animals or how having a tusk might affect them. And if anything, it would be more logical to expect a very important trait to be more widespread, not less common, among other similar types of animals. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the scientists&rsquo; conclusion has anything to do with shyness. And because shyness and detection of the threat of freezing water aren&rsquo;t logically connected, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that Laidre would expect narwhals to become less shy over time if the tusk serves that important purpose.</p>",

Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars&rsquo;s surface as a reason the scientists expected that marsquakes had multiple origins.

The table contains information about the right ascensions, periods, and frequencies of various pulsar stars called RRATs. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is defined as the time between consecutive pulses. The table shows that the period of RRAT J0614-03 is 0.136 seconds, which is the lowest number of all the periods of the RRATs listed in the table. If the period is the time between consecutive pulses, and J0614-03 has the shortest period, then J0614-03 has the shortest amount of time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, J0545-03 has a period of 1.074 seconds and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses. Therefore, since J0545-03 and J0121+53 have different periods, they do not have the same amount of time between consecutive pulses. Choice C is incorrect because according to the table, J1654-2335 has a period of 0.545 seconds, which is not the longest period of all the RRATs listed in the table. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and both J0545-03 and J0121+53 have longer periods than J1654-2335, so J1654-2335 does not have the longest time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table. Choice D is incorrect because according to the table, J0103+54 has a period of 0.354 seconds, and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and only J0121+53 has more than one second of time between consecutive pulses, not J0103+54.</p>",

The text states that violins made in Cremona in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries sound superior to modern violins. It then indicates that some experts attribute the difference to different woods being used to make these violins, but both Cremonese and modern violins are made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the difference.

Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin&rsquo;s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to &ldquo;new analysis,&rdquo; which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood. </p>",
