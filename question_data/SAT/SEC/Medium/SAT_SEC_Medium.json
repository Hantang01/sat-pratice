Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause (&ldquo;scholar&hellip;materialism&rdquo;) and the following noun phrase with the conjunction &ldquo;and&rdquo; results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the novel depicts the upper classes of New York society as &ldquo;an apt assessment,&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to mark the boundary between the main clause and the supplementary noun phrase with appropriate punctuation. </p>",

This choice creates a tense issue. &ldquo;Has leveraged&rdquo; is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present.

This choice creates a tense issue. &ldquo;Is leveraging&rdquo; is the present tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals&rsquo; talents in 1860, so the present tense isn&rsquo;t appropriate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. &ldquo;Will leverage&rdquo; is the future tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals&rsquo; talents in 1860, so the future tense isn&rsquo;t appropriate. </p>",
