The infinitive form \"to place\" is the only nonfinite option among the choices that makes sense in context.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The object for the verb \"was\" is \"first,\" and \"places\" is acting as a modifier for \"first.\" What was the thing that Parker&rsquo;s finding did? What was it the first to do? Place humans in North America 10,000 years ago. When a verb acts as a modifier, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject), but \"places\" is a finite form of the verb. Choice B is incorrect. The object for the verb \"was\" is \"first,\" and \"placed\" is acting to modify \"first.\" What was it that Parker&rsquo;s finding was the first to do? Place humans in North America 10,000 years ago. When a verb acts as a modifier, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject), but \"placed\" is a finite form. \"Placed\" can also be a past participle, but that wouldn&rsquo;t make sense here because the meaning of \"the first placed humans\" would be unclear. Choice C is incorrect. The object for the verb \"was\" is \"first,\" and \"place\" is modifying \"first.\" What was the thing that Parker&rsquo;s finding did? What was it the first to do? Place humans in North America. When a verb acts as a modifier, it must be nonfinite (i.e., not conjugated to a specific subject), but \"place\" is a finite form of the verb. Additionally, \"place\" can&rsquo;t serve as a noun here, because it results in an illogical sentence (the \"finding\" wasn&rsquo;t \"the first place\").</p>",
