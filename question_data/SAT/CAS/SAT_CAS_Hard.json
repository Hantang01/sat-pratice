Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television&rsquo;s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo &ldquo;foretells,&rdquo; or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo&rsquo;s &ldquo;rejection&rdquo; of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo &ldquo;recants&rdquo; something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that Harjo recants television&rsquo;s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn&rsquo;t a belief and thus isn&rsquo;t something that can be recanted. </p>",

This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut&rsquo;s reign is unlikely.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"an imaginative\" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts.

Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut&rsquo;s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt.

The text establishes that many countries have adopted risk-disclosure requirements for financial products due to concerns that consumers don&rsquo;t understand the risks associated with the products. According to the text, Seira et al. found that the effects of such messaging on consumer behavior were small and temporary. The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited. Thus, the underlined portion notes a factor&mdash;very low cost&mdash;that led the researchers to not completely dismiss risk-disclosure messaging despite their evidence of its limited utility.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t refer to a particular type of risk-disclosure messaging, whether Seira et al. considered it or not; the underlined portion simply indicates that the cost of the messaging (broadly) is very low, which makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging&rsquo;s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low&mdash;meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited.</p>",

The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months&rsquo; work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer&rsquo;s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel&rsquo;s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel&rsquo;s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text&mdash;that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>",

The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same&mdash;posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood.

Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the consequences of raising the age at which retirees begin receiving government funds. The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous. Thus, \"stymie,\" which means to prevent or greatly hinder, is the most logical choice in context.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"compound\" would most nearly mean multiply or greatly enhance. The text indicates that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds will increase the amount of time retirees are dependent on working family members for financial support. This would likely have a negative rather than a positive effect on wealth creation. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"disparage\" would most nearly mean criticize or defame. Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create. The text does suggest that workers providing funds to retirees works against those workers&rsquo; wealth accumulation, but not that the support to retirees exceeds the workers&rsquo; accumulated wealth.</p>",

The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen&ouml;der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people&rsquo;s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people&rsquo;s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue.

Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries&rsquo; varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>",

The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis regarding this question&mdash;which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer&mdash;and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team&rsquo;s hypothesis presented earlier in the text.

The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuac&aacute;n (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuac&aacute;n influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuac&aacute;n. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows &ldquo;refinements of,&rdquo; or improvements on, Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it&rsquo;s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, the Tikal citadel&rsquo;s builders improved on it.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing &ldquo;precursors of&rdquo; Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture&mdash;or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture&mdash;would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuac&aacute;n. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuac&aacute;n, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, then the Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture enough to imitate it.

Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium&rsquo;s development. Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text&rsquo;s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games&mdash;the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how&mdash;is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers&mdash;namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members&mdash;the author doesn&rsquo;t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and television&mdash;namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this text&mdash;video games&mdash;rely more heavily on credits than scholars of film and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear. </p>",

The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn&rsquo;t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement.

In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments.

Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave. </p>",

Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say &ldquo;[m]ore recently&rdquo; Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but &ldquo;that European breeds lack,&rdquo; which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira&rsquo;s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey&rsquo;s evidence has been undermined.

Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens.

Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"probability\" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood.</p>",

The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful&mdash;solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth&mdash;and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare.

The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun&rsquo;s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist.

The underlined sentence doesn&rsquo;t do this. It describes Cruse&rsquo;s criticisms&mdash;it never mentions what Cruse did want the movement to do instead. Choice B is incorrect.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that &ldquo;in fact, as many as half&rdquo; the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase &ldquo;in fact&rdquo; establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was &ldquo;satisfactory,&rdquo; or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was &ldquo;commonplace,&rdquo; or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view.&nbsp;</p>",
