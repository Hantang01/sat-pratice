Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"retain\" would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"highlight\" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities.</p>",

In this context, \"corroborate\" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables&mdash;that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations.

The text discusses the Bayeux Tapestry, making the point that the workers who produced the huge tapestry in the eleventh century might not have ever produced a tapestry so large before. The text goes on to suggest that because of this lack of previous experience, the workers developed and refined the process of joining the tapestry&rsquo;s panels over time as they worked. The last sentence of the text then provides an example of an observation that suggests the workers&rsquo; process changed: clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels the workers joined first and virtually invisible joins completed later. Thus, the underlined sentence serves to support an argument about the workers who produced the tapestry.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the example given in the last sentence of the text has to do with how the panels of the Bayeux Tapestry were joined by the workers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text never identifies any people or places depicted in the tapestry. Choice C is incorrect because the last sentence compares how early panels in the Bayeux Tapestry were joined with how later panels in the same tapestry were joined; it doesn&rsquo;t make any comparison between the Bayeux Tapestry and other tapestries from the same time in France. Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence doesn&rsquo;t address the location where the Bayeux Tapestry was created; the first sentence of the text presents it as a given that the tapestry was created in France, but nothing in the text indicates how that origin was determined.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer&rsquo;s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer&rsquo;s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn&rsquo;t appear to contain any life. Fierer&rsquo;s team says that though this doesn&rsquo;t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer&rsquo;s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer&rsquo;s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer&rsquo;s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn&rsquo;t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer&rsquo;s team wouldn&rsquo;t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn&rsquo;t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn&rsquo;t detect them, but the author doesn&rsquo;t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer&rsquo;s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>",

Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer&rsquo;s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of.

Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel&rsquo;s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text&mdash;that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>",

The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly&mdash;that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm&mdash;each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;quantities&rdquo; means certain amounts or numbers of something.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same&mdash;posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.</p>",

The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members.

Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create.

Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t imply that graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written&mdash;that is, well crafted&mdash;as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted.</p>",

The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi&rsquo;s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi&rsquo;s progress.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to the study findings described in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen&ouml;der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people&rsquo;s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people&rsquo;s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries&rsquo; varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author&rsquo;s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has \"stole[n] away\" the speaker&rsquo;s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting&rsquo;s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"&mdash;a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker&rsquo;s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can&rsquo;t return the speaker&rsquo;s love. The text continues by stating that there&rsquo;s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof&rsquo;s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive&mdash;that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn&rsquo;t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.</p>",

Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others.

As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California&rsquo;s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California&rsquo;s coast.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph&rsquo;s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph&rsquo;s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.</p>",

Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers&mdash;namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members&mdash;the author doesn&rsquo;t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and television&mdash;namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games.

In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city&rsquo;s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals&mdash;or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as &ldquo;a living showcase of San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District. </p>",

The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese&rsquo;s typical journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it.

Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual flight behavior, the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t discuss this.

Text 1 discusses painter Edgar Degas&rsquo;s insistence that his works remain in their original painted frames, which contrasted with the gold frames that were typical of the Paris art scene at the time. The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire \"to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\" Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters \"placed their works in painted frames\" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that \"the frame&rsquo;s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting.\" Though differing on Impressionist painters&rsquo; rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn&rsquo;t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to \"harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting,\" implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas&rsquo;s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters&rsquo; attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1&rsquo;s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it.</p>",

The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending \"to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement,\" making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement&rsquo;s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement&rsquo;s participants.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera&rsquo;s work. It only indicates that Herrera&rsquo;s work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does identify an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text indicates has been overemphasized, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does summarize the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, the rest of the text does not address the effectiveness of \"comparatively low-profile neighborhood institutions and projects.\" Instead, the text suggests that those projects were led by people with a variety of approaches to community activism.</p>",

The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they&rsquo;re foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don&rsquo;t behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter &ldquo;patches of low species richness&rdquo;&mdash;that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species&mdash;they&rsquo;ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources.

Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there&rsquo;s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense flower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict. </p>",

However, Text 2 goes on to say &ldquo;[m]ore recently&rdquo; Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but &ldquo;that European breeds lack,&rdquo; which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira&rsquo;s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey&rsquo;s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues&rsquo; evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey&rsquo;s evidence is. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from &ldquo;1321&ndash;1407 CE&mdash;over a century before Europeans invaded the region&rdquo; and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey&rsquo;s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey&rsquo;s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.&nbsp;</p>",

As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth&rsquo;s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began.

Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.&rsquo;s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth&rsquo;s mantle and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t argue that the temperature of Earth&rsquo;s mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement.

The text begins by noting that Anne &ldquo;reveled in the world of color about her&rdquo;&mdash;that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped &ldquo;aesthetic sense,&rdquo; or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as &ldquo;messy things&rdquo; and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne&rsquo;s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect.

Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla&rsquo;s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne&rsquo;s personality. </p>",

The text begins by noting the rise of political blogs with readily identifiable ideological alignments in the early 2000s. The text then indicates that some commentators saw this as a positive development, citing a reason why (their difference from traditional news). Finally, the text goes on to contrast those commentators with others who have a negative opinion of the rise of political blogs (because they increase political polarization among their readers). This context supports the idea that the second group of commentators is less positive than the first: thus, the second group of commentators is less optimistic, or sanguine.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it would not make sense in this context to describe those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs as less \"recalcitrant,\" or obstinately uncooperative, than those commentators who supported political blogs.

The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega&rsquo;s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn&rsquo;t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe&mdash;nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn&rsquo;t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.</p>",

The point of the text is that the view of the Port of Oakland from the subway train as it rises from underground is significant to Moss, not whether it is described as being correct, which the text does not address.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Bastos&rsquo;s study of a wild kea parrot. In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos&rsquo;s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos&rsquo;s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos&rsquo;s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics&rsquo; opinion regarding the kea&rsquo;s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea&rsquo;s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics&rsquo; opinion in this context must be that the kea&rsquo;s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos&rsquo;s claim that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea&rsquo;s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea&rsquo;s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea&rsquo;s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.</p>",

In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice&rsquo;s plan is that it can be easily arranged. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice&rsquo;s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that it can be arranged &ldquo;faintly,&rdquo; or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice&rsquo;s plan was made in haste, the text doesn&rsquo;t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan&rsquo;s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to it as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn&rsquo;t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn&rsquo;t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to the plan as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. </p>",

This generalization is exemplified by the text&rsquo;s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and <em>B. terrenus</em> beetles.

The text explains that although skeptics had thought that direct evidence of gravitational waves would be too faint to be detected, researchers led by Gonz&aacute;lez claimed that a chirping sound captured by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory antennas nevertheless provided such evidence. The text goes on to say that detailed statistical analysis confirmed the observation of gravitational waves with a high degree of confidence&mdash;that is, with near certainty&mdash;a finding that helped to preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal&rsquo;s attribution to gravitational waves might be ambiguous or doubtful.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inconspicuousness\" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect. Although the text indicates that skeptics had doubted whether gravitational waves could be observed directly because of their presumed faintness (which suggests that gravitational waves were expected to be difficult to detect), the blank portion of the text isn&rsquo;t referring to the possibility that gravitational waves are unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is Gonz&aacute;lez&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s observation of a chirping sound that they attributed to gravitational waves, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that through statistical analysis, they ruled out the possibility that the sound they observed was undetectable. Rather, the skeptical view presented in the text suggests that there could be some ambiguity about the source of the chirping, but statistical analysis virtually eliminated this uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"discretion\" would mean good judgment, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that an event, such as the detection of gravitational waves, would show judgment, much less that the event&rsquo;s capacity to exercise good judgment would be precluded by statistical analysis confirming its attribution. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"probability\" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun&rsquo;s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful&mdash;solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth&mdash;and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic&mdash;increased brightness in a particular region of the corona&mdash;comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun&rsquo;s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun&rsquo;s corona, which would not make logical sense.</p>",

Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old&mdash;much older than the Clovis people&rsquo;s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces&mdash;that they are human-made tools&mdash;that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group&rsquo;s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn&rsquo;t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group&rsquo;s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.</p>",

According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn&rsquo;t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues&rsquo; perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it&rsquo;s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they&rsquo;re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it.

The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"imagine\" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it&rsquo;s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he&rsquo;s fabricating the experiences he records.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Ronyoung Kim&rsquo;s novel <em>Clay Walls</em>. In this context, \"distinct\" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim&rsquo;s novel features three distinct perspectives.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim&rsquo;s novel as \"required,\" or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There&rsquo;s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim&rsquo;s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim&rsquo;s novel as \"unintended,\" or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim&rsquo;s novel as \"unknown,\" or not revealed, wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel&rsquo;s perspectives are in fact known.</p>",
