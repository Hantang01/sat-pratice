Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez&rsquo;s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez&rsquo;s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez&rsquo;s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works.

Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez&rsquo;s works.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author&rsquo;s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, Mr. Ryder had to choose the time, not that he had to demonstrate, or show, the time; it&rsquo;s not clear what it would mean to demonstrate a time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"determine\" doesn&rsquo;t mean measure, or control with careful restraint. The text isn&rsquo;t indicating that Mr. Ryder is carefully controlling time itself; such a thing isn&rsquo;t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose; it&rsquo;s Mr. Ryder&rsquo;s decision that is measured, not the time he eventually chooses.</p>",

In this context, &ldquo;enthusiasm for&rdquo; means excitement about. The text explains that <em>Blind Spot </em>consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose&mdash;two elements that correspond to Cole&rsquo;s passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole&rsquo;s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling &ldquo;indifference to&rdquo; his two passions wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn&rsquo;t care about photography or writing&mdash;in which case they wouldn&rsquo;t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels &ldquo;concern about,&rdquo; or uneasiness about, his passions. The text&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;culminates&rdquo; indicates that <em>Blind Spot </em>represents a triumphant climax of Cole&rsquo;s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels &ldquo;surprise at,&rdquo; or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole&rsquo;s feeling about his passions &ldquo;culminates&rdquo; in a book that &ldquo;evocatively&rdquo; combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them. </p>",

The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city&rsquo;s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place.

Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals&mdash;or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as &ldquo;a living showcase of San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District. </p>",

It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"genuine,\" or actual and true, while the one by Salazar&rsquo;s team wasn&rsquo;t, since the text treats the finding by Salazar&rsquo;s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate (\"it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought\").

These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, \"reforms\" most logically completes the text.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"investigations\" most nearly means attempts to understand something. And although it is plausible that an attempt to improve the postal system would involve investigations, nothing in the text provides a logical basis for understanding the example of changes like affixing stamps to letters as an investigation. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"expansions\" most nearly means additions to something. Although the text indicates that some new policies were adopted, nothing in the text suggests that the overall number of policies increased, which expansions would seem to entail. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"possessions\" most nearly means items of personal property or things that otherwise belong to, or are part of, something. The text provides no logical context for understanding changes like affixing stamps to letters as possessions.</p>",

In this context, \"traced\" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Ta&iacute;nos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"offered,\" or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba.</p>",

This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico&rsquo;s history. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez&rsquo;s role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was &ldquo;unpredictable,&rdquo; or tended to behave in ways that couldn&rsquo;t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly &ldquo;secretive&rdquo; figure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government&rsquo;s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an &ldquo;ordinary,&rdquo; or common and typical, figure in Mexico&rsquo;s history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable figure. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, &ldquo;simply&rdquo; most nearly means easily, or involving minimal difficulty or effort. The text first provides Alice&rsquo;s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel&rsquo;s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice&rsquo;s plan is that it can be easily arranged. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice&rsquo;s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that it can be arranged &ldquo;faintly,&rdquo; or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice&rsquo;s plan was made in haste, the text doesn&rsquo;t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan&rsquo;s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to it as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn&rsquo;t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn&rsquo;t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to the plan as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. </p>",

The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"imagine\" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it&rsquo;s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he&rsquo;s fabricating the experiences he records.</p>",

Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone&rsquo;s hair) to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone&rsquo;s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined.</p>",
