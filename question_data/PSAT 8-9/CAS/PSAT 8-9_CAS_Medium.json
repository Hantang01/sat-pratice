The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records.

Although it&rsquo;s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down.

Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice&rsquo;s plan was made in haste, the text doesn&rsquo;t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan&rsquo;s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to it as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn&rsquo;t have this meaning in this context.

The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals&mdash;or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as &ldquo;a living showcase of San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District. </p>",

These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"&mdash;a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker&rsquo;s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can&rsquo;t return the speaker&rsquo;s love. The text continues by stating that there&rsquo;s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof&rsquo;s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive&mdash;that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way.

Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present.

Choice C is incorrect. Although the text&rsquo;s second sentence mentions that fires were built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn&rsquo;t the focus of the underlined portion.

The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

Thus, the underlined portion of the text functions to clarify the meaning of a scientific term.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses broadly on an environmental concern, the underlined phrase does not; it simply indicates what a surfactant is. Choice C is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses on a scientific discovery (Liu and colleagues&rsquo; solution to the problem of plastic recycling), the underlined phrase does not explain its significance; it simply defines a scientific term used in the discussion. Choice D is incorrect.

In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature&rsquo;s \"surging life is at its full\" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be \"a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds.\" The speaker says further that during summer, \"feeling sleeps / Gathering strength\" for future efforts.

Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn&rsquo;t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when \"feeling\" gathers \"strength for efforts yet to come.\" Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time \"when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,\" it doesn&rsquo;t discuss the season&rsquo;s relationship to the speaker&rsquo;s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, \"void\" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness.

Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music&rsquo;s quick rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it. Because of jazz music&rsquo;s influence, jazz tap quickly developed into a dance form that was very different from earlier kinds of tap dance.</p>",

In this context, \"traced\" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Ta&iacute;nos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect.
