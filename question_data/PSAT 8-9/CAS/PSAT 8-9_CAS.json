The text establishes that many countries have adopted risk-disclosure requirements for financial products due to concerns that consumers don&rsquo;t understand the risks associated with the products. According to the text, Seira et al. found that the effects of such messaging on consumer behavior were small and temporary. The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited.

Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging&rsquo;s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low&mdash;meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited.</p>",

Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest&rsquo;s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was \"long-expected,\" but characterizing Miss Pyne as \"stately and calm\" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and flowers and birds singing).</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, &ldquo;simply&rdquo; most nearly means easily, or involving minimal difficulty or effort. The text first provides Alice&rsquo;s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel&rsquo;s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice&rsquo;s plan is that it can be easily arranged. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice&rsquo;s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that it can be arranged &ldquo;faintly,&rdquo; or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice&rsquo;s plan was made in haste, the text doesn&rsquo;t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan&rsquo;s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to it as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;simply&rdquo; can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn&rsquo;t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn&rsquo;t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; and the narrator refers to the plan as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; and &ldquo;neatly,&rdquo; or efficiently, arranged. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by pointing out an obstacle to observing the astronomical phenomenon of the NCP: the NCP is visible only at night. The text then indicates that, inspired by the ability of some insects and birds to navigate using visualizations of polarized sunlight, researchers devised a way to locate the NCP during daylight. The text then indicates that the researchers mimicked the insects&rsquo; and birds&rsquo; polarized-light visualization capabilities using a polarimetric camera. Thus, the text notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of certain animals that inspired a solution to that obstacle, and then explains how researchers used an optical device to mimic that ability.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate this is the case, let alone that the NCP is relevant to a majority of navigational tools. Furthermore, the text doesn&rsquo;t state that researchers discovered that insects and birds navigate without the NCP; rather, it indicates that it&rsquo;s known that some animals navigate by using skylight polarization to locate the NCP during the day and that this knowledge inspired the method the researchers devised. Choice B is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn&rsquo;t state that this is the case. Furthermore, the text discusses how some animals&rsquo; use of navigational strategies based on the same celestial occurrence served as the inspiration for the researchers&rsquo; polarized-light approach, not as the basis for a comparison of the relative effectiveness of animal and human methods of navigation. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that humans have typically been able to locate the NCP visually at night and indicates that some animals use the NCP to navigate, the text doesn&rsquo;t state that humans use the NCP for navigation. The text therefore doesn&rsquo;t emphasize a difference between how humans and animals use the NCP for this purpose. Furthermore, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that existing navigational instruments will be augmented with polarimetric technologies.</p>",

Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as &ldquo;a living showcase of San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred.

Torchy&rsquo;s story reflects the experience of the Great Migration (1910&ndash;1970), when millions of Black Americans left the South in search of opportunities in other parts of the United States. <em>Torchy Brown</em> thus shows how Ormes used comics to comment humorously on issues affecting Black Americans, which she continued to do throughout her career.</p>",

Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team&rsquo;s hypothesis presented earlier in the text.

Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat.

The text continues by stating that there&rsquo;s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof&rsquo;s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive&mdash;that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way.

Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present.

In this context, \"corroborate\" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables&mdash;that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners&rsquo; conclusions.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"circumvent,\" or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it&rsquo;s possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners&rsquo; conclusions, but findings from a study can&rsquo;t choose to get around something.

In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context \"prudently\" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"cordially\" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. It&rsquo;s unclear how \"less deliberately signaled\" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"inadvertently\" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort.</p>",

Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other.

Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it.

The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months&rsquo; work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer&rsquo;s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel&rsquo;s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel&rsquo;s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text&mdash;that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>",

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi&rsquo;s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi&rsquo;s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn&rsquo;t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.</p>",

The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence.

For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood&rsquo;s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs.

Text 1 characterizes this discovery as &ldquo;especially promising&rdquo; and a sign of &ldquo;exciting progress&rdquo; in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR&rsquo;s function in humans isn&rsquo;t yet known, it&rsquo;s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1&rsquo;s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s observations about EGR in humans. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven&rsquo;t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t say that Text 1&rsquo;s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1&rsquo;s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s findings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1&rsquo;s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn&rsquo;t at all dismissive of Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s findings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"&mdash;that is, comparatively very little&mdash;in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel&rsquo;s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there&rsquo;s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn&rsquo;t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t imply that graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written&mdash;that is, well crafted&mdash;as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted.</p>",

The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen&ouml;der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people&rsquo;s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people&rsquo;s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries&rsquo; varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>",

As used in this context, \"dominance\" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California&rsquo;s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California&rsquo;s coast.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word \"creativity\" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California&rsquo;s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad&rsquo;s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California&rsquo;s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its \"insignificance,\" or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad&rsquo;s \"neutrality,\" or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would \"neutrality\" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described.

In this context, \"inconspicuousness\" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect.

In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun&rsquo;s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful&mdash;solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth&mdash;and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic&mdash;increased brightness in a particular region of the corona&mdash;comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun&rsquo;s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun&rsquo;s corona, which would not make logical sense.</p>",

When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no <em>B. terrenus</em> beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey \"can persist across centuries and continents.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn&rsquo;t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the findings by Chang and colleagues that&rsquo;s an \"alternative\" to an explanation presented elsewhere in the text.</p>",

The text begins by noting that Anne &ldquo;reveled in the world of color about her&rdquo;&mdash;that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped &ldquo;aesthetic sense,&rdquo; or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as &ldquo;messy things&rdquo; and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne&rsquo;s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn&rsquo;t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla&rsquo;s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne&rsquo;s personality. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author&rsquo;s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo&rsquo;s series <em>Reservation Dogs</em> focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a &ldquo;rejection&rdquo; of the typical approach to depicting Native characters.

This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are \"occupying,\" or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text doesn&rsquo;t discuss who controls these programs but instead indicates that some cities are establishing incentives that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses.

Text 1 describes Sharif&rsquo;s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively&mdash;that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively.

The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of \"unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze\"&mdash;that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight.

As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren&rsquo;t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn&rsquo;t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works.</p>",

In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos&rsquo;s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos&rsquo;s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos&rsquo;s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics&rsquo; opinion regarding the kea&rsquo;s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea&rsquo;s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics&rsquo; opinion in this context must be that the kea&rsquo;s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos&rsquo;s claim that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea&rsquo;s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea&rsquo;s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea&rsquo;s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea&rsquo;s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.</p>",

The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire \"to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\" Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters \"placed their works in painted frames\" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that \"the frame&rsquo;s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting.\" Though differing on Impressionist painters&rsquo; rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn&rsquo;t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to \"harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting,\" implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas&rsquo;s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters&rsquo; attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1&rsquo;s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it.</p>",

The text focuses solely on the fact that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn&rsquo;t mention how this characteristic or traffic signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes &ldquo;traffic signals,&rdquo; which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because &ldquo;disregarded&rdquo; means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn&rsquo;t discuss how people react to traffic signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s.

The underlined statement mentions a category of animals that have a feature in common: they tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughout their lifetimes. The text then presents the speculation of some researchers that the Arctic woolly mammoth might also share this characteristic. However, an examination of the content of strontium in the strata (or layers) of a woolly mammoth tusk indicated that contrary to the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis, the mammoth had an expanding range in its environment that contracted in its last 1.5 years of life. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined statement presents a pattern of behavior (the habit of certain animals of staying within a fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a theory of exceptions to that pattern; rather, the researchers are merely concerned with whether one particular animal has behavior consistent with the pattern. Choice C is incorrect. Though the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the behavior of certain animals (their tendency to stay within a fixed geographic range), this is not done in order to show why a method described later in the text failed to show whether another animal showed that behavior; rather, the method of analysis of strata of a woolly mammoth tusk showed that the mammoth&rsquo;s behavior was different from that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined statement mentions a trait shared by a number of animals (their fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a hypothesis regarding the origin of that trait; rather, the researchers are concerned with whether another particular animal shares that trait.</p>",

As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth&rsquo;s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence).

Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.&rsquo;s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth&rsquo;s mantle and therefore wouldn&rsquo;t argue that the temperature of Earth&rsquo;s mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement.

Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut&rsquo;s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer&rsquo;s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer&rsquo;s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn&rsquo;t appear to contain any life. Fierer&rsquo;s team says that though this doesn&rsquo;t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer&rsquo;s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer&rsquo;s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer&rsquo;s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn&rsquo;t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer&rsquo;s team wouldn&rsquo;t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn&rsquo;t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn&rsquo;t detect them, but the author doesn&rsquo;t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer&rsquo;s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>",

The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly (\"she was still in the B&rsquo;s\") and that she struggled with some books (\"some of the B&rsquo;s had been hard going\"), she doesn&rsquo;t give up because she thinks of herself as \"a reader.\" These details show Francie&rsquo;s resolve.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the \"dry ones\"&mdash;that is, the boring books&mdash;and that some of the books were \"hard going,\" meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss Francie&rsquo;s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it&rsquo;s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott) whose book Francie has read as well as several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) she has encountered, the text doesn&rsquo;t say whether Francie admires any of the books she&rsquo;s read so far. Instead, the text focuses on the time and effort she devotes to reaching her goal of reading all the books in the world&mdash;even ones she doesn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn&rsquo;t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians&rsquo; approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas. </p>",

Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old&mdash;much older than the Clovis people&rsquo;s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces&mdash;that they are human-made tools&mdash;that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group&rsquo;s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn&rsquo;t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group&rsquo;s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants.

Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends.

Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts &ldquo;endure&rdquo; can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn&rsquo;t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist <em>despite</em> the absence of someone else, one can&rsquo;t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent.

Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn&rsquo;t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds&rsquo; nests.

The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous.

Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create.

In this way, Derksen&rsquo;s compositions blend different cultures. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen&rsquo;s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t mention any difficulties Derksen encountered when producing her album. Rather, the text describes how the songs on the album exemplify how Derksen combines music from two different cultures.\n&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because although the text mentions Derksen&rsquo;s Cree heritage and suggests that she relies on knowledge of both Indigenous and classical music when she composes her songs, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss her musical training. Additionally, the text is primarily focused on how Derksen combines different cultural traditions, not on contrasting Derksen&rsquo;s training with her heritage. </p>",

In this context, \"contingent on\" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph&rsquo;s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect.

Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it&rsquo;s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because \"ubiquitous\" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it&rsquo;s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is \"extraneous,\" or irrelevant. Instead, the text indicates that use of specific software is required to view certain artworks from this period and that the discontinuation of the software renders the works inaccessible.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg&rsquo;s collection. In this context, the phrase &ldquo;depended on&rdquo; means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve &ldquo;books, art, and other materials&rdquo; created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;admired&rdquo; means respected and approved of. Although it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because &ldquo;disagreed with&rdquo; means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg&rsquo;s friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world. Choice C is incorrect because &ldquo;warned&rdquo; means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. Nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg thought his friends and colleagues were in any danger, let alone that he warned them of danger. </p>",
