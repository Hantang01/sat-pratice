The tree produces a milky substance called latex that is used to make rubber. The bark of <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> is helpful for the process of making rubber because it has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex.

The text explicitly states that this feature of <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> is \"helpful for the process of making rubber.\"</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t mention the quality of the rubber produced from the latex of <em>Hevea brasiliensis </em>or compare its quality to that of rubber produced from other sources. Choice C is incorrect because the text never discusses the climates in which <em>Hevea brasiliensis </em>grows. Moreover, the text mentions only one region where this tree is found: the Amazon rainforest. Choice D is incorrect. Because the text states that <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> is the world&rsquo;s \"main source of natural rubber,\" it can be inferred that there is at least one other source.

Five young siblings have just moved with their parents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect&rsquo;s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The only technique discussed in the text for achieving extremely high volume is Wagner&rsquo;s addition of more instruments to create a bigger, louder orchestra. Choice C is incorrect because the text never says that Wagner built or used a specially designed concert hall to increase volume through echoes. The only technique discussed in the text is Wagner&rsquo;s addition of more instruments to create a bigger, louder orchestra.
