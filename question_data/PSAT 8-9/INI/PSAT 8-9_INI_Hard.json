The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Nazca Lines included a photograph showing a whalelike geoglyph that Isla hadn&rsquo;t known about before attending the exhibit, even though Isla &ldquo;specializes in&rdquo; Nazca Lines geoglyphs. Given his expertise, and his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text strongly suggests that Isla believed he would have noticed the glyph if he had been to its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelike geoglyph is likely in a location Isla had not previously been to.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t address either the species of whale that the geoglyph is meant to represent or its relationship to the earliest humans in the area that is now Peru. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the photograph of the whalelike geoglyph was on display at a &ldquo;German exhibit,&rdquo; that exhibit was specifically &ldquo;about the Nazca Lines,&rdquo; which the text indicates are located in Peru. Choice D is incorrect.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student&rsquo;s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn&rsquo;t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn&rsquo;t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a <em>higher </em>percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.</p>",

Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration. After analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Jan Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about the effect of leave time on the attentiveness of university employees. According to the text, the researchers&rsquo; study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave, and a group who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2&ndash;4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who\ntook no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave with those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1&ndash;5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2&ndash;4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers&rsquo; conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.</p>",

The text then mentions the device&rsquo;s two functions: a formal one (giving structure to lines of verse) and a ritualistic one. The text indicates that the relation between the words in a difrasismo may appear tenuous without the additional information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture but that the meaning becomes intelligible in the context of that information.

The text states that Boeri&rsquo;s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics&rsquo; concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale&rsquo;s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.</p>",

This suggests that the <em>M. robustus</em> octopuses that hatch at the Octopus Garden leave the site when they reach an intermediary state of development, returning only as adults for reproductive purposes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text never discusses the stability of the <em>M. robustus</em> population at the site, only that the scientists observed 6,000 adults, hatchlings, and eggs there. Further, the text presents the site&rsquo;s temperatures as likely beneficial. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t provide any details about the eggs at the site and makes no mention of nests; it indicates only that eggs are present along with hatchlings and adults. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the hatchlings feeding at the Octopus Garden, indicating only that the temperatures at the site are probably beneficial and that the site is likely used for reproduction.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion about Aztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, according to Purcell&rsquo;s interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual&rsquo;s actions in relation to that individual&rsquo;s societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell&rsquo;s analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual&rsquo;s actions are rooted in that person&rsquo;s position in the community and the actions&rsquo; effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action&rsquo;s effects and the individual&rsquo;s social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text&rsquo;s claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual&rsquo;s action is dependent on the action&rsquo;s effects on the community and the person&rsquo;s specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors&mdash;the other being the person&rsquo;s societal role&mdash;that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles.</p>",

The text explains that it&rsquo;s hard for researchers to test for the effects that elected office has on people because finding people to serve as a control group is difficult. The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don&rsquo;t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected office). Because researchers aren&rsquo;t able to influence who wins elections, they&rsquo;re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will find it difficult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that finding information about politicians&rsquo; behavior is difficult.

Studying people who have already held elected office wouldn&rsquo;t provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause.

The text explains that the poem had previously been published without the notes in a quarterly journal. It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author&rsquo;s own explanation of the poem. Therefore, if it were true that the publishers of the stand-alone volume had requested the notes to make the book attractive to readers who already had a copy of the journal issue, this fact would support the student&rsquo;s claim that the notes were included primarily as a marketing device. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because&nbsp;the student&rsquo;s claim is about the motivation for including the explanatory notes in the stand-alone volume, not about changes that might have been made to the poem itself for publication in that volume; moreover, the text never suggests that such changes were made. Choice B is incorrect because the student&rsquo;s claim is about why the explanatory notes were included in the stand-alone volume, not about how the notes affected readers&rsquo; and critics&rsquo; subsequent experience of the poem. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that the poet drafted multiple versions of the explanatory notes doesn&rsquo;t directly address the issue of whether the notes were intended as a marketing device, as the student claims; the correspondence would support this claim only if it showed that the poet had revised the notes specifically to make them useful to the marketing of the stand-alone volume. </p>",

The text states that data gathered by the <em>Curiosity</em> rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars&rsquo;s surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hern&aacute;ndez et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) <em>was</em> present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from. Choice C is incorrect because the evidence described in the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that there were streams at the Murray Formation for an extended period and a lake for just a short time. The abundance of fine grains suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) was present for an extended time, not just a short time, and the sections of coarse grains suggest that one or more streams (bodies of flowing water) were intermittently present while the lake existed, not at a separate time. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but <em>did</em> occasionally dry out.</p>",

According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (<em>P.</em> <em>miniata</em>) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star&rsquo;s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming \"headless\" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t identify how any particular region of sea stars&rsquo; bodies influences the layout of sea stars&rsquo; radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as \"known\") and doesn&rsquo;t address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars&rsquo; origin, Formery et al.&rsquo;s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is \"headless.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about <em>P. miniata</em> sea stars&rsquo; body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between <em>P. miniata </em>and <em>S. kowalevskii </em>acorn worms.

The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female figure who is fishing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female figure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of fishing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female figure engaged in fishing does not indicate with certainty that the figure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with fishing, and the figure might be anyone at all). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about how often Venus was depicted fishing in Roman art: it only implies that in certain instances a female figure may or may not be Venus. Choice C is incorrect because Carla Brain&rsquo;s proposed explanation for the presence of the cupids makes no reference to the female figure, and so the possibility that the figure in the artworks is in fact Venus cannot be definitively eliminated. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the only reasonable way to interpret the figure is as Venus. </p>",

The graph shows the average number of individuals reporting directly to CEOs during three different time periods: the individuals are divided into managers and department leaders. The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991&ndash;1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996&ndash;2001 period it was four, and during the 2001&ndash;2008 period it was almost seven.

Choice B is incorrect because the average number of managers reporting directly to their CEO was highest in the 2001&ndash;2008 period, not in the 1996&ndash;2001 period. Choice C is incorrect.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years&mdash;1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees&mdash;grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.&nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the student&rsquo;s conclusion about weather patterns in Anchorage and Fairbanks. According to the graph, the amount of sunshine increases in both cities from April to June: in Anchorage, the number of monthly hours increases from about 250 to just under 300, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours increases from about 300 to just under 350. Also according to the graph, the amount of sunshine decreases in both cities from June to September: in Anchorage the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 300 to about 125, and in Fairbanks the number of monthly hours decreases from just under 350 to about 125. Thus, the monthly hours of sunshine in both cities follow a similar pattern, increasing from April to June and then decreasing from June to September. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because, according to the graph, the monthly hours of sunshine in both Anchorage and Fairbanks decrease from June to July. They don&rsquo;t hold steady. In June there are slightly less than 300 hours of sunshine in Anchorage and slightly less than 350 hours in Fairbanks. Then, in July there are approximately 250 hours of sunshine in both cities.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that Anchorage and Fairbanks have less than 200 monthly hours of sunshine only in August and September. For the rest of the months represented in the graph, both cities have more than 200 monthly hours of sunshine. Choice D is incorrect because, according to the graph, Anchorage doesn&rsquo;t have more than 300 monthly hours of sunshine from April to June. In addition, both cities have more than 200 hours of sunshine in July, although the amount of sunshine does decrease to less than 200 monthly hours in August and September. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that TMAO reduces water&rsquo;s compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species&rsquo; level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water&rsquo;s tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules&rsquo; tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water&rsquo;s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water&rsquo;s molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.</p>",

The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that <em>fabula</em> and <em>syuzhet</em> can&rsquo;t fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning.

The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that the 2006 velocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the first estimate that exceeded the velocity needed to maintain orbit around the Milky Way. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital velocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that Besla and colleagues&rsquo; analysis found that the velocity from the 2006 study (378 km/s) was too high for the LMC to maintain orbit around the Milky Way.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of <em>Instant Mural</em>. According to the text, the 1974 work <em>Instant Mural</em> involved taping two Asco members (Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval) to an outdoor wall as a direct commentary on constraint (limitation or restriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on Valdez&rsquo;s role in the work and on social limitations women faced at the time&mdash;an approach that fails to explain the role of Sandoval, a man&mdash;people should consider that in 1974 (and long before) the art establishment limited recognition of Chicano artists to those who created murals with social and historical subjects, making it challenging for nonmuralist Chicano artists (such as Asco&rsquo;s members) to show their work. The text suggests that considering the situation with the art establishment leads to a conclusion that accounts for the fact that <em>Instant Mural</em> is explicitly about constraint and features both a woman and a man taped to the wall: <em>Instant Mural</em> isn&rsquo;t a reflection of the social constraints placed on women specifically but instead is a reflection on the constraining aesthetic expectations placed on Chicano artists in general (that is, the limits resulting from the lack of recognition of Chicano artists of any gender who did not create sociohistorical murals).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that the art establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did recognize Chicano muralists to the exclusion of other Chicano artists, so there&rsquo;s no reason to assume Asco&rsquo;s work <em>Instant Mural</em> was intended to represent Chicano muralists&rsquo; frustration; it&rsquo;s far more likely that Asco&rsquo;s members&mdash;described as Chicano nonmuralists&mdash;were representing their own frustration at being unrecognized by the art establishment. Choice B is incorrect. The text emphasizes that while a common approach to <em>Instant Mural</em> focuses on Valdez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails to account for the presence of a man in the work, there is a conclusion that explains Sandoval&rsquo;s role. But concluding that <em>Instant Mural</em> represents a double constraint experienced specifically by female Chicano artists would still fail to account for the inclusion of a man in the work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that <em>Instant Mural</em> can be understood as something other than a commentary on social constraints women faced in 1974, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the work is best understood as a critique of the content of any other artworks. The text doesn&rsquo;t address how Chicano culture is depicted in sociohistorical murals; it discusses such murals only to make the point that in 1974 (and earlier) the art establishment recognized Chicano artists who produced them to the exclusion of Chicano nonmuralists, indicating a constraint all of Asco&rsquo;s members faced, regardless of gender.</p>",

The graph compares the metal content of two groups of plants, one with kanamycin exposure and a control group without such exposure. The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure. Choice C is incorrect. The graph shows that the zinc levels for the control plants (those without kanamycin exposure) were around 400 parts per million, not 300 parts per million, and that the zinc levels for plants with kanamycin exposure were around 300 parts per million, not 400 parts per million. </p>",

The text begins by stating that the mating call of the male t&uacute;ngara frogs also attracts frog-biting midges, which prey on the frogs&rsquo; blood. Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sufficient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion&mdash;that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers&rsquo; trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue. This finding supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers&rsquo; conclusion&mdash;that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of t&uacute;ngara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a finding that would contradict the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a finding contrary to the researchers&rsquo; conclusion.</p>",

Annie Peng Cui and Jennifer Wiggins recruited 171 participants (ages 18&ndash;60) online for an initial study and 83 students (ages 18&ndash;31) at a state university for a second study to test the effect of three different messages&mdash;&ldquo;pay what you can,&rdquo; &ldquo;pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo;&mdash;on how much participants would pay for concert tickets.

The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition than they do under both the \"pay what you can\" and the \"pay what you want\" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a finding that supports the idea that sellers can benefit when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the \"pay what you can\" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn&rsquo;t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the \"pay what you think it&rsquo;s worth\" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it&rsquo;s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants&rsquo; valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets&rsquo; actual market price. Choice D is incorrect. Although the wide variation in participant valuations would support the idea that consumer valuations tend to be heterogeneous, neither the text nor the graph provides any information from which to discern the relative levels of variance among the responses from participants in either study.</p>",

The text begins by saying that many scholars view Zelda mainly in terms of her marriage to F.

Therefore, those scholars who focus on Zelda only as an inspiration for F.

Although the text does mention that Zelda Fitzgerald &ldquo;likely influenced&rdquo; her husband&rsquo;s literary work, its focus is on Zelda&rsquo;s own writing, not on her husband&rsquo;s writing or factors that might have influenced it. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not discuss F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald&rsquo;s opinions of each other&rsquo;s works. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does suggest that F.

The text makes this claim based on the fact that ancient trade routes connected Puerto Rico with Colombia but not with Peru. However, if it&rsquo;s true that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were genetically less similar to ancient guinea pigs in Colombia than to ancient guinea pigs in Peru, this would suggest that the Puerto Rican guinea pigs didn&rsquo;t descend from Colombian guinea pigs. Instead, Puerto Rican guinea pigs&rsquo; greater genetic similarity to Peruvian guinea pigs implies that ancient guinea pigs in Puerto Rico were likely brought to the island from Peru, despite the lack of direct ancient trade routes between the two regions.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While a finding about how common guinea pig imagery is in ancient Puerto Rican art would indicate the cultural significance of guinea pigs, it wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to a claim about the geographical origin or descent of the guinea pig population on the island. The guinea pigs depicted in the artwork could have descended from guinea pigs in either Colombia or Peru; therefore, the finding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that guinea pigs in Puerto Rico probably came from Colombia and descended from Colombian guinea pigs. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that modern breeds of guinea pigs don&rsquo;t look like images of guinea pigs in ancient art from Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Peru wouldn&rsquo;t address the ancestral relationships between ancient guinea pig populations in these three regions. Therefore, the finding would neither weaken nor strengthen the claim that guinea pigs in Puerto Rico probably came from Colombia and descended from Colombian guinea pigs. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about the population sizes of guinea pigs in ancient Colombia and ancient Peru wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to a claim about which population the Puerto Rican guinea pigs likely descended from. The smaller guinea pig population of Peru could still have been the source for the Puerto Rican guinea pig population.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text based on supporting data in the graph. The text indicates that in the fly <em>D. melanogaster</em>, <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em> are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested <em>D. melanogaster</em>&rsquo;s resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> and <em>A. sicerae</em> bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: <em>DptA</em> silenced (referred to as type A), <em>DptB</em> silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> correlates with <em>DptA</em> activity but not with <em>DptB</em> activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to <em>P. rettgeri</em>). The graph shows the post&ndash;<em>A. sicerae</em> infection results, which indicate that <em>DptB</em> activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas <em>DptA</em> activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when <em>DptA</em> activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when <em>DptB</em> activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with <em>DptA</em> activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that <em>DptB</em> may have developed as a specific defense against <em>A. sicerae</em>.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that <em>DptA</em> activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where <em>DptA</em> alone was silenced, <em>DptB</em> alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em>, which would be necessary to determine whether <em>DptA </em>conferred defense against <em>A. sicerae</em> in the presence of<em> DptB</em>. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: <em>P. rettgeri</em> and <em>A. sicerae</em>. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in <em>DptA</em> is associated with resistance to <em>P. rettgeri</em> while <em>DptB</em> activity is not, and that <em>DptB</em> activity is associated with resistance to <em>A. sicerae</em> while <em>DptA</em> is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em>. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of <em>DptA</em> and <em>DptB</em> silenced, or inactive.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Vikash V. Gayah&rsquo;s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic&mdash;namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average&mdash;which implies faster travel times between package destinations&mdash;would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections&mdash;both with and without dedicated left-turn signals&mdash;would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn&rsquo;t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher&rsquo;s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times.</p>",

A 2022 study showed that when presented with cane toad eggs as well as eggs of native Australian amphibians, cane toad tadpoles disproportionately consumed eggs of their own species. This behavior results from their attraction to bufadienolide, a chemical produced by the eggs of cane toads but not by the eggs of native amphibians.

The text then explains that the finding is important because of the &ldquo;previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.&rdquo; If there haven&rsquo;t been any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America&rsquo;s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the first, then the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it&rsquo;s the first nesting site found in northern regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because there is no mention in the text about any difficulties that Fiorelli and colleagues faced when they were excavating the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that the nesting and breeding site in the Brazilian mine was occupied by sauropods other than titanosaurs. The text simply mentions that titanosaurs are sauropod dinosaurs and presents the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that the site they discovered was for titanosaurs.&nbsp;</p>",

The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplifies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specific types of crops in some regions. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that more women in central Ondo mainly cultivate cereals than mainly cultivate root crops (approximately 36% and 20%, respectively). Additionally, it doesn&rsquo;t effectively complete the example because the graph shows that female farmers don&rsquo;t make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers for any type of crop in central Ondo. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t effectively complete the example; it simply states that a relatively equal proportion of women across the three regions mainly cultivate cereals, which doesn&rsquo;t address the value for that proportion and thus doesn&rsquo;t show that a majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating certain crops are female. </p>",

The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benefit from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect.

While the text does state that scientists from many fields are researching artificial leaves, they&rsquo;re doing so to address the fact that the leaves are not yet commercially viable, rather than in response to an increase in commercial use. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does explain that artificial leaves help split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen gas using catalysts, it doesn&rsquo;t argue that this process is more efficient than photosynthesis. This is merely a detail of the text and not the main idea, which is about the additional research needed to improve the cost and efficiency of these artificial leaves. Choice D is incorrect.

The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don&rsquo;t sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers&rsquo; claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold&mdash;even if those profits are earned less frequently and don&rsquo;t support weekly loan payments.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn&rsquo;t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn&rsquo;t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors&mdash;meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn&rsquo;t depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn&rsquo;t affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale.</p>",

In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, &ldquo;Each, coming&rdquo;&mdash;that is, each new year as it comes&mdash;&ldquo;brings ambitions high.&rdquo; In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (&ldquo;each, departing&rdquo;), it &ldquo;leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.&rdquo; A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases &ldquo;the years go swiftly by,&rdquo; &ldquo;Each, coming,&rdquo; and &ldquo;each, departing&rdquo; indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a &ldquo;brazen tongue,&rdquo; a figurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to &ldquo;ominous stillness,&rdquo; there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (&ldquo;many a squandered day&rdquo;), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret.

The text then highlights a research team&rsquo;s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents.

Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes.</p>",

The text begins by stating that Tomas and Tereza&rsquo;s dog Karenin felt disrupted by a recent move because of his dislike of change. The text then goes on to suggest that this is because the way a dog experiences time differs from the way humans experience time: time for a dog doesn&rsquo;t move linearly, going \"on and on, from one thing to the next,\" but instead moves circularly, \"like the hands of a clock.\" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cyclical pattern characterized by routine and predictability, with each day \"following the same path.\" The text then concludes by providing examples of seemingly insignificant changes in routine that profoundly \"disturbed [Karenin&rsquo;s] sense of time,\" causing him to feel displeasure. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Karenin&rsquo;s sense of time as a dog involves a strong preference for predictability and an aversion to disruption.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes Karenin&rsquo;s displeasure with the recent move to a new home, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the move has made his negative responses more pronounced than they once were. Rather, in accounting for Karenin&rsquo;s displeasure with the move to Switzerland, the text explains that Karenin generally has a negative response to any kind of change. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that Karenin comprehends time similarly to how Tomas and Tereza comprehend it. On the contrary, the text strongly implies a contrast between dogs&rsquo; circular experience of time with the way humans experience time as a straightforward progression that can be \"plotted on a straight line.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text provides no indication that a change in the places and objects surrounding Karenin causes him to feel as though time is accelerating. Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"&mdash;that is, always in a regular and predictable way.</p>",

Cats exhibited a low level of surprise when owners&rsquo; voices were played twice from the same speaker, but they showed a high level of surprise when the voice was played once each from the two different speakers.</p>",

The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this finding would directly support the scholars&rsquo; claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this finding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the finding wouldn&rsquo;t directly support the scholars&rsquo; claim that the majority of the game&rsquo;s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this finding doesn&rsquo;t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars&rsquo; claim about the board game. Choice D is incorrect because this finding doesn&rsquo;t mention the board game at all, referring only to the remains of other goods found at the site in Oman, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars&rsquo; claim about the board game. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists&rsquo; claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program&rsquo;s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists&rsquo; claim about the program&rsquo;s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program&rsquo;s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well.</p>",

In contrast, the text indicates that audiences and readers may need to be familiar with several centuries of English history in order to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays.

Since twentieth-century plays aren&rsquo;t mentioned, there&rsquo;s no basis in the text for the idea that some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies are more relevant than twentieth-century plays to today&rsquo;s audiences. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>is thematically accessible to today&rsquo;s audiences, it doesn&rsquo;t suggest that <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is more accessible than Shakespeare&rsquo;s other tragedies. Rather, the text presents <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>as an example to support the idea that Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies hold continued appeal for today&rsquo;s readers and theatergoers. Choice D is incorrect. Although experts in English history would likely possess the knowledge needed to understand Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays, the text never mentions such experts or suggests that they would enjoy the history plays more than Shakespeare&rsquo;s other works. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it uses data from the table to effectively support the claim that book genres that typically require the reader to start at the beginning of the story and read straight through are more commercially successful as e-books than other genres. For each of three years, the table presents four book genres and the percentage of total sales for each genre in e-book format. Cookbooks, a nonfiction genre, do not require the reader to read straight through. According to the table, 10.5 percent of total cookbook sales in 2016 were in the e-book format. The 2016 percentage of e-book sales was 36.7 percent in the science fiction and fantasy genre, which are typically stories read straight through from start to finish. The higher percentage of total sales of the story-based e-books in 2016 supports the claim in the text. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it compares the e-book sales of romance books in 2006 to those in 2016. Romance books are meant to be read straight through from start to finish. The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are not as commercially successful in e-book format as those that do. As this choice is only comparing e-book sales for one genre, it does not support the claim. Choice C is incorrect because both science fiction and fantasy and romance novels are fiction books meant to be read straight through from beginning to end. The text claims that books that are not stories and do not require reading straight through are less commercially successful in e-book format than those that do. As this choice does not compare e-book sales of story genres to e-book sales in genres that are not stories, it does not support the claim. Choice D is incorrect. Although the data in the table show that the travel guide e-books made up a greater percentage of total sales in 2016 than in 2011, this doesn&rsquo;t illustrate the claim in the text that e-books in nonfiction genres not meant to be read straight through are less commercially successful. The claim cannot be supported without comparing the percentage of e-book sales between fiction and nonfiction book genres from the table.&nbsp;</p>",

The text indicates that these dialects share a feature: putting emphasis on the \"r\" sound when it appears in certain positions in words. The text goes on to state that records indicate the Upland South was colonized largely by people of Scottish ancestry. It is reasonable to assume that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers were influenced by the English dialects spoken by their ancestors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed&mdash;that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn&rsquo;t address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many Upland South colonizers were the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers had been influenced by the English dialects spoken by the colonizers&rsquo; ancestors in Scotland and had acquired their emphasis on the \"r\" sound from those ancestors&rsquo; dialects&mdash;not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound is part of English dialects spoken in the Upland South today, which almost certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be the case if people from Scotland, who were the main colonizers of the Upland South, had eliminated that linguistic feature from their dialects.</p>",

The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it&rsquo;s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar&rsquo;s range didn&rsquo;t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget&rsquo;s artist likely wouldn&rsquo;t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar&rsquo;s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget&rsquo;s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE.

artifacts dating to 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago have been recovered from the Evron Quarry in Israel. Likely created by the hominin <em>Homo erectus</em>, the artifacts have no visual features suggesting that they were exposed to fire, leading some scholars to conclude that these hominins had not acquired control of fire. But Zane Stepka and colleagues recently used a new method to determine whether these artifacts had been exposed to temperatures above 400\u00b0C (the typical temperature campfires reach) and concluded that the hominins who inhabited the site may have had control of fire.\u00a0</p>",

The text first describes the distinctive <em>pachuca </em>style of dress adopted by some Mexican American women during World War II, saying that some criticized it and asserted that women should dress traditionally. The text then goes on to contrast this position with that of historians, who \"see things differently\": according to these historians, the <em>pachuca </em>style showed a wish for freedom and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women at the time. Therefore, according to the text, historians think that the <em>pachuca</em> style was a way for Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict social expectations.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text explicitly describes the <em>pachuca</em> style as a distinctive look adopted during the World War II era. It does not indicate that the <em>pachuca </em>style influences fashion in the United States in the present day. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not indicate that Mexican American women wore the <em>pachuca </em>style to show support for the United States during World War II; rather, the style was a means of self-expression and rebellion against social expectations. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not compare the <em>pachuca </em>style to other fashion trends: the <em>pachuca </em>style is the only style mentioned.</p>",

The graph shows that in 2010, the number of computer services jobs was approximately 6,000, which is the same approximate number of jobs in engineering services. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of jobs in technical consulting services and the number of jobs in computer services were about the same, at approximately 5,000.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the graph shows that in 2010 the number of computer services jobs (about 6,000) was higher than the number of  technical consulting services jobs (about 4,000), in 2019 the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not about the same as the number of engineering services jobs (about 6,000). Choice C is incorrect because according to the graph, the number of jobs in computer services was lower than the number of jobs in engineering services in 2019, not 2010. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not higher than the number of jobs in engineering services (about 6,000). Choice D is incorrect because the graph shows that the number of computer services jobs was about the same as the number of technical consulting services jobs in 2019, not 2010. This also means the number of computer services jobs could not have been lower than the technical consulting services jobs in 2019 if they were about the same.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it provides a quotation that effectively supports the student&rsquo;s claim about the film <em>One Night in Miami&hellip;</em>. The quotation states that in researching the play on which the film was based, Kemp Powers only found superficial details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that there is very little information about the meeting in the historical record. In the absence of greater details, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them. Therefore, the quotation effectively supports the claim that the film is best understood not as a precise retelling of a historical event but as a deeply informed imaginative rendering of that event.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, Powers was inspired to write a play and, later, to adapt it into a screenplay, it doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing what had occurred in the meeting. Instead, it states that Powers didn&rsquo;t initially plan to write a story only &ldquo;focusing on the meeting itself&rdquo; but rather had considered writing a &ldquo;much longer&rdquo; and more expansive work about the meeting&rsquo;s four participants. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation doesn&rsquo;t discuss Powers&rsquo;s approach to representing historical events in his play and in the film; instead, the quotation focuses on the film&rsquo;s positive critical reception by mentioning that it received numerous awards and nominations. Choice C is incorrect. Although the quotation references historical events that are discussed directly in the play and film by explaining how the four historical figures featured in the story engage in political debates about contemporary issues, it doesn&rsquo;t specify to what extent Powers&rsquo;s representation of what occurred during the 1964 meeting in Miami is a factual retelling of what happened and how much is an imaginative rendering of what might have happened. Rather, the quotation focuses on Powers&rsquo;s description of the film&rsquo;s basic premise and how the characters engage with the historical context of its setting. </p>",

Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text or table suggests that the Chang&rsquo;e 5 samples were used to confirm the ages of the Apollo samples.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that weaken the student&rsquo;s conclusion about the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards. The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student&rsquo;s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is &ldquo;entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,&rdquo; meaning that the spider population wouldn&rsquo;t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student&rsquo;s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn&rsquo;t weaken the student&rsquo;s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren&rsquo;t the only cause of the reduction.&nbsp;</p>",

The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers&rsquo; conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes.

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice C is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn&rsquo;t support Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it&rsquo;s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth without adding nitrogen under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only the growth with and without nitrogen fertilization under moderate climate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don&rsquo;t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in <em>L. pertusa</em> coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph&rsquo;s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em>. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of <em>L. pertusa</em> declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the <em>L. pertusa</em> population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the <em>L. pertusa</em> decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral&rsquo;s decline near the Mauritanian coast.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in <em>L. pertusa</em> (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral&rsquo;s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral&rsquo;s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in <em>L. pertusa</em> than after&mdash;because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after&mdash;the graph doesn&rsquo;t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral&rsquo;s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em>. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn&rsquo;t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of <em>L. pertusa</em> in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.</p>",

The text explains that economist Adam Smith&rsquo;s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term \"putatively,\" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn&rsquo;t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing \"putatively,\" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor&rsquo;s use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor&rsquo;s importance to Smith&rsquo;s work.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith&rsquo;s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith&rsquo;s metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text&rsquo;s emphasis on Smith&rsquo;s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith&rsquo;s metaphor, the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the metaphor is a \"useful model\" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals&rsquo; selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith&rsquo;s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith&rsquo;s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views.</p>",

The text focuses on formations of parallel ice ridges on Jupiter&rsquo;s moon Europa that are said to be formed by the same mechanism that formed a parallel set of ridges on Greenland&rsquo;s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Greenland, water on the surface seeps to the lower portion of the ice sheet, resulting in uplift that creates the ridges, and it states that although Europa lacks liquid water on its surface, the same process could be driven by an ocean below Europa&rsquo;s surface.

According to the text, some scientists believe that a comet fragment hitting Earth caused the cooling of the Younger Dryas period to come about. The text then indicates that a team of scientists found a crater in Greenland, which some believe supports the theory of a comet fragment hitting Earth to initiate the Younger Dryas. However, the text also notes that the team was unable to determine the age of the crater.

Choice C is incorrect because the debate in the text centers on the age of the crater found, not the cause of the crater.

According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them&mdash;that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000&ndash;57,000 newtons and 35,000&ndash;63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000&ndash;235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000&ndash;34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn&rsquo;t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson&rsquo;s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can&rsquo;t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don&rsquo;t support Barrett and Rayfield&rsquo;s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates. </p>",

While this choice does mention emotionality scores, it only connects them to star ratings, not to box office success. Choice C is incorrect. The fact that many movies received an average star rating doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about the relationship between emotionality and box office success. Choice D is incorrect.

The text doesn&rsquo;t address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn&rsquo;t serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn&rsquo;t help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true&mdash;that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn&rsquo;t have any bearing on the researchers&rsquo; claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn&rsquo;t necessarily beneficial on its own and isn&rsquo;t the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn&rsquo;t support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. </p>",

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support Pirotta and her team&rsquo;s claim that East Australian humpback whales may not live only on stored energy during migration. The text explains that it has long been thought that East Australian humpback whales store extra energy during the feeding season and then use that energy to survive while traveling to their breeding grounds. If it were true that citizen scientists have often seen the whales feeding as they migrate to the breeding grounds, that would indicate that the whales sometimes feed and take in additional energy during the journey, meaning that they may not rely only on energy they stored before migrating.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that citizen scientists have observed many different types of marine animals feeding alongside the whales would have no bearing on the team&rsquo;s claim; the behavior of other animals is irrelevant, and without indicating the timing of the observed feeding, the finding wouldn&rsquo;t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration. Choice C is incorrect because finding that citizen scientists have more often observed whales on the way to their breeding grounds than returning to their feeding grounds would have no bearing on the team&rsquo;s claim. Since it would provide information about the timing of observations but not about the whales&rsquo; observed activities, the finding wouldn&rsquo;t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration. Choice D is incorrect because finding that citizen scientists have recently started seeing the whales migrate to their breeding grounds earlier in the year would have no bearing on the team&rsquo;s claim. Since it would provide information about a change in the timing of migration but not about the whales&rsquo; observed activities while migrating, the finding wouldn&rsquo;t reveal whether the whales rely only on previously stored energy or ever take in additional energy during migration.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal regarding factors that affect urban land expansion (ULE). According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions&rsquo; relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal suggests that Region 1&rsquo;s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.&rsquo;s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970&ndash;2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000&ndash;2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period. Thus, whereas the data suggest governments in Region 2 became more efficient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those governments became less efficient, not more.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents the quotation that best supports the student&rsquo;s claim that in <em>The Politics</em>, Aristotle gives advice on preserving constitutions&mdash;preventing governments from falling and maintaining order&mdash;and specifically asserts that in a healthy state, laws must be followed as strictly as possible and infractions should not be overlooked even if they are minor. The philosopher states that when Aristotle builds his argument about the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that transgression, or violation of law, will ruin the state if it \"creeps in unperceived,\" or goes unnoticed. The philosopher then adds that Aristotle illustrates this point by comparing the situation to one in which small but frequent expenses diminish a fortune almost unnoticeably until, eventually, the fortune is entirely gone. In other words, the philosopher indicates that Aristotle makes the point that total obedience to law preserves a healthy state while even small violations, if ignored, will undermine the health of the state.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the philosopher addresses Aristotle&rsquo;s observation about corruption within the government (in particular, preventing the possibility that members of the government can take bribes), and although corruption can involve infractions, the observation is about a subset of people within the state and isn&rsquo;t directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law throughout the state. Choice C is incorrect because the philosopher discusses Aristotle&rsquo;s point about those who would intentionally destroy a constitution altogether and the need for rulers to remind the populace that it would be dangerous for a constitution to collapse, but neither idea is directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law. Choice D is incorrect because the philosopher explains that Aristotle makes the point that oligarchic leaders may retain power by having members of disenfranchised classes participate in government alongside governing classes, and this point doesn&rsquo;t address the importance of ensuring obedience to the law and addressing even minor violations.</p>",

The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017&ndash;2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group.

Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.&nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the influence of decision-making modes on consumers&rsquo; choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker&rsquo;s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn&rsquo;t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker&rsquo;s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker&rsquo;s convenience. Thus, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.</p>",

The narrator of the text indicates that the story about Hans Castorp will be told not because there is something particularly notable about him, since he is pleasant but \"perfectly ordinary,\" but because the story itself is remarkable (\"very much worth telling\"). The narrator then notes that there is a benefit in being at the heart of the story&mdash;that it is \"in Hans Castorp&rsquo;s favor\" that the story is his, and maybe uniquely so (\"not every story happens to everybody\"). Thus, the text suggests both that the story that will be told is a remarkable one that happened to an unremarkable person and that it is reasonable to argue that the person at the center of a valuable story takes on some of the story&rsquo;s value.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text makes the point that \"not every story happens to everybody,\" the narrator doesn&rsquo;t state that stories are interesting simply because the people they are about are unique. Rather, the narrator suggests that one particular story is \"very much worth telling\" on its own and that Hans Castorp benefits from the fact that the story is remarkable and may be unique to him. Further, the narrator never suggests that the story will be hard to understand even though it is old. Choice B is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text suggests that Hans Castorp is of no particular importance, since he is a \"perfectly ordinary\" person, the narrator never reveals what makes the story of Castorp important, just that \"the story itself\" is \"very much worth telling.\" The narrator states that the story \"took place long ago,\" is \"covered with the patina of history,\" and can be told only \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past,\" but the story&rsquo;s age and the way it must be told aren&rsquo;t presented as reasons the story is important; the narrator is simply providing details about how the story will be told. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator of the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that all stories about people who are \"perfectly ordinary\" (like Hans Castorp) must be told in particular ways to make it clear why those stories are consequential. Further, the narrator suggests that Hans Castorp&rsquo;s story must be told \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past\" because it took place so long ago, not because telling it that way will convey the story&rsquo;s importance.</p>",

According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.</p>",

The quotation therefore supports the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn&rsquo;t find some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to coupons that the shopper received, not to a new store layout. Thus, the quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn&rsquo;t carry those products, so the quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases.</p>",

The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru&rsquo;s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth&rsquo;s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; claim.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion, not strengthen it.

Noting that Cisneros&rsquo;s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character&rsquo;s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn&rsquo;t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren&rsquo;t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella.

Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the scientists&rsquo; conclusion has anything to do with shyness. And because shyness and detection of the threat of freezing water aren&rsquo;t logically connected, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that Laidre would expect narwhals to become less shy over time if the tusk serves that important purpose.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Uto-Aztecan languages. The text explains that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family descended from a single language (believed to have originated in what is now the US Southwest), resulting in similarities across the family&rsquo;s languages; however, the branches don&rsquo;t have similar vocabulary for maize, even though maize has been cultivated by all Uto-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest&mdash;the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family&rsquo;s origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize. If maize arrived after the division occurred, however, the tribes in the two regions likely would have developed vocabulary pertaining to maize separately, at the times when they acquired the crop.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to how some Uto-Aztecan tribes obtained maize wouldn&rsquo;t directly address the role of language. Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don&rsquo;t have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch&mdash;that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to the timing and source of maize acquisition wouldn&rsquo;t directly address the role of language. Furthermore, the text implies that southern Uto-Aztecan tribes probably acquired maize before the northern tribes did, given the evidence that maize originated in Mexico&mdash;the location of the best-known representative of the southern branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family&mdash;before spreading to the north.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that complete the text&rsquo;s discussion of lizard species&rsquo; use of maximal speed when escaping predators. According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%&ndash;39% of maximal speed, 40%&ndash;49% of maximal speed, 50%&ndash;59% of maximal speed, 60%&ndash;69% of maximal speed, 70%&ndash;79% of maximal speed, 80%&ndash;89% of maximal speed, and 90%&ndash;100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%&ndash;59%, 60%&ndash;69%, 70%&ndash;79%, and 80%&ndash;89%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn&rsquo;t organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%&ndash;100% (8 species total). However, these data don&rsquo;t complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don&rsquo;t complete the text&rsquo;s discussion of lizard species&rsquo; use of maximal speed when escaping predators.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that two languages can convey similar amounts of information even if they&rsquo;re spoken at different rates. The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it isn&rsquo;t true that Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech of the five languages shown. According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn&rsquo;t support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they&rsquo;re spoken at different rates.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it isn&rsquo;t true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they&rsquo;re spoken at different rates.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because it isn&rsquo;t true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does. According to the table, Serbian conveys information at a rate of around 39.1 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.0 bits-per-second rate at which Spanish conveys information.&nbsp;</p>",

Although the text states that the mapping didn&rsquo;t show what researchers had expected based on their knowledge of other magnetic fields, there&rsquo;s no indication that G47&rsquo;s magnetic field had ever been mapped before. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers were surprised that the magnetic field was different from, not similar to, the magnetic fields of other galactic bones; the text states that because other galactic bones in the Milky Way are more uniform, the researchers had expected the magnetic field of G47 to be more uniform than it turned out to be.</p>",

The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named &lsquo;Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from &lsquo;Oumuamua&rsquo;s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within &lsquo;Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: &lsquo;Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues&rsquo; claim.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from &lsquo;Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of &lsquo;Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: &lsquo;Oumuamua&rsquo;s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner&rsquo;s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to &lsquo;Oumuamua, but the text states that &lsquo;Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken the scientists&rsquo; hypothesis about icebergs that appear to be green. The text indicates that most icebergs are either mostly white or blue in color but that some icebergs in Antarctica appear to be green. The text goes on to say that the scientists hypothesized that this green color occurs when yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in ocean waters mixes with blue ice. A finding that both blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon would suggest that something other than yellow-tinted organic carbon causes some icebergs&rsquo; green color, since the blue icebergs that contain yellow-tinted organic carbon remained blue instead of turning green. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists&rsquo; hypothesis was that blue icebergs, not white ones, change color when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon. A finding that white ice,&nbsp;because of its air bubbles, doesn&rsquo;t change color when it&rsquo;s mixed with dissolved organic carbon would therefore have no bearing on the scientists&rsquo; hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on Antarctic icebergs that appear to be green. It doesn&rsquo;t indicate that icebergs in locations other than Antarctica have been found to have a green hue. A finding that dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than in other places would therefore have no bearing on the scientists&rsquo; hypothesis that green color in icebergs in Antarctica is caused by yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon mixing with blue ice. Choice C is incorrect because, according to the text, the scientists&rsquo; hypothesis was that blue icebergs turn green when their ice mixes with yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in the sea around them. If that&rsquo;s correct, one would expect blue icebergs and green icebergs to be located at a distance from each other since all blue icebergs in an area where the waters contain yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon would take on a green hue. A finding that blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other would therefore strengthen, not weaken, the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis. </p>",

Ice with air bubbles trapped in it looks white because much of the light reflects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light travels deep into the ice and only a little of it is reflected. However, some icebergs in the sea around Antarctica appear to be green. One team of scientists hypothesized that this phenomenon is the result of yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in Antarctic waters mixing with blue ice to produce the color green.</p>",

The text describes an experiment by Eva Ka&scaron;tovsk&aacute; and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Ka&scaron;tovsk&aacute; and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what&rsquo;s important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn&rsquo;t change&mdash;that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn&rsquo;t address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.</p>",

g\">e.g.</span>, agreeableness) or one considered ignoble (<span data-ssml-sub-alias=\"e g\">e.g.</span>, cynicism). A survey recorded participants&rsquo; ratings of the candidates&rsquo; likability and showed that across participants, ignoble-trait candidates were less likable than admirable-trait candidates. However, when the researchers factored in the participants&rsquo; own personality-trait scores, on a scale of 1 (least ignoble) to 7 (most ignoble), they concluded that this relative ranking of candidates persisted except among the participants with high ignobility scores.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that the trend of admirable-trait candidates being rated as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates held true when participants&rsquo; own personality-trait scores were factored in, except among participants with high ignobility scores. The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants&rsquo; own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants&rsquo; ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates&rsquo; likability ratings (as participants&rsquo; ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates&rsquo; likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates&rsquo; likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants&rsquo; ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion. The conclusion isn&rsquo;t just that participants gave different ratings to the two types of candidates&mdash;it&rsquo;s that participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores specifically gave higher likability ratings to admirable-trait candidates than to ignoble-trait candidates and that participants with high ignobility scores didn&rsquo;t.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that an observable pattern in time references in novels reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting&mdash;which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light&mdash;many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers&rsquo; conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers&rsquo; conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this would reflect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the underlined claim. The text indicates that Swahili is the first language of up to 15 million people worldwide. The text goes on to claim, in the underlined portion, that even in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili, many of the language&rsquo;s speakers don&rsquo;t have Swahili as their first language. The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language. This information about Swahili speakers in Tanzania therefore supports the claim that many Swahili speakers in countries where nearly everyone speaks Swahili speak it as a language other than their first language (such as their second, third, or fourth language).&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe information in the table. According to the table, Tanzania has 61 million Swahili speakers, not at most 15 million Swahili speakers. Additionally, the table indicates that 100 percent of Tanzania&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, which means that the number of Swahili speakers in the country and the country&rsquo;s total population should be the same, not that they should differ by such a large amount. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s no information in the table or the text that indicates where people who speak Swahili as their first language live. Although Kenya&rsquo;s total population can be inferred from the table&mdash;if Kenya has 55 million Swahili speakers and 100% of Kenya&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, then Kenya must have a population of 55 million people&mdash;nothing suggests that all the people who speak Swahili as their first language live in a single country, let alone that they all live in Kenya.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that 100 percent of Kenya&rsquo;s population and 25 percent of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&rsquo;s population speak Swahili, this comparison is irrelevant to the claim that Swahili isn&rsquo;t the first language of many of its speakers even in countries where almost everyone speaks Swahili. On its own, a difference in the proportions of the population who speak Swahili cannot reveal whether those Swahili speakers have Swahili as their first language or a subsequent language.&nbsp;</p>",

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of <em>T.</em> <em>navigans</em> based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons&mdash;namely, that <em>T. navigans</em> had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of <em>T. navigans</em>, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that <em>T. navigans</em> had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make <em>T. navigans</em> different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, <em>T. navigans</em> likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that <em>T. navigans</em> would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that <em>T. navigans </em>had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.</p>",

The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn&rsquo;t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the text, providing an example that illustrates that the annual increases in international tourism revenue in 2017 and 2018 weren&rsquo;t universal. The table shows the annual spending by international tourists (which indicates annual international tourism revenue) in 2016&ndash;2018 in four Asian countries. According to the table, annual spending by international tourists in South Korea was $21.0 billion in 2016 and then decreased to $17.2 billion in 2017. This decrease shows that not all of the countries included in the table saw increases in annual international tourism revenue in 2017.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn&rsquo;t provide any data regarding revenue from tourism by residents of those countries. Even if that data were provided, it wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to the claim that the trend of annual increases in international tourism revenue in 2017 and 2018 was not universal. Choice B is incorrect because the data in the table do not support the statement that Japan&rsquo;s international tourism revenue was higher in 2016 than it was in 2018: the table indicates that Japan&rsquo;s annual international tourism revenue was $33.5 billion in 2016, which is less than Japan&rsquo;s annual international tourism revenue of $45.3 billion in 2018. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table does indicate that Thailand&rsquo;s revenue from international tourism was higher than that of the other three Asian countries in 2016, 2017, and 2018, this information has no direct bearing on the text&rsquo;s claim that not all the Asian countries represented in the table saw an increase in revenue from international tourism.</p>",

The text describes a study examining the relationship between a species of parasitic tapeworm, <em>A. brevis</em>, and its host insect, the <em>T. nylanderi</em> ant. According to the text, researchers were surprised to find that the tapeworm extends the life of its ant host, rather than reducing it. The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants&rsquo; share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study&rsquo;s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how <em>A. brevis</em> is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to <em>A. brevis</em> while caring for infected ants. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the relative abilities of infected and uninfected ants to escape predators: in fact, predators are not mentioned in the text at all. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not supply any information about the average lifespans of the ants in colonies without parasitic activity; the text only indicates factors that lengthen and shorten the lifespans of ants in parasitized colonies.</p>",

The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn&rsquo;t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of <em>E. coli</em> bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other <em>E. coli</em> strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for <em>E. coli</em>, and similarity between strains (of <em>E. coli</em> or of other pathogens) isn&rsquo;t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of <em>E. coli</em>, since Somvanshi et al.&rsquo;s paper turned purple when exposed to <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn&rsquo;t bind to different strains of <em>E. coli</em>. The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of <em>E. coli</em> (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of <em>E. coli</em>. In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low.</p>",

Using cells with only perovskite and no silicon, however, resulted in no improvement in efficiency over silicon-based cells. The text also states that perovskite captures light in the blue range of the solar spectrum and silicon captures light in the red range of the spectrum. If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater efficiency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved efficiency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%&ndash;22% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more efficient than silicon-based cells are.

The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn&rsquo;t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn&rsquo;t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s.

While this finding suggests that the map couldn&rsquo;t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge&mdash;and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers&mdash;of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn&rsquo;t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn&rsquo;t have been created in the mid-1400s.

This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s.

If mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain material not found in older mantle-derived rocks, that material must have originated somewhere other than the mantle.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis about the plants&rsquo; dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage&mdash;such as access to phosphorus&mdash;from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don&rsquo;t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don&rsquo;t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn&rsquo;t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There&rsquo;s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers&rsquo; hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn&rsquo;t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.</p>",

The text indicates that researchers found that when <em>A. ocellaris</em> is exposed to low levels of ALAN, spawning frequency and egg fertilization aren&rsquo;t significantly affected but hatching is completely inhibited&mdash;that is, the eggs never hatch. Therefore, if <em>A. ocellaris</em> were to settle only in regions where the fish would be regularly exposed to low levels of ALAN, their eggs would stop hatching and their reproductive success would be at risk.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that exposure to low levels of ALAN had no significant effect on egg fertilization for <em>A. ocellaris</em>, so there&rsquo;s no reason to expect there would be any significant difference in rates of successful egg fertilization between areas with low levels of ALAN and areas without ALAN. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss the particular effects of low levels of ALAN on any species of coral reef fish besides <em>A. ocellaris</em>.

The table presents the average time pollinators spent per floral morph. The data in the table shows that for pin flowers, the average time spent per flower by all pollinator genera was higher for flowers that had been artificially damaged than for intact flowers. By contrast, for thrum flowers, the difference in time spent on intact and damaged flowers is seen for only some pollinator genera.

The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s&mdash;during most of Morrison&rsquo;s time working there&mdash;than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House&rsquo;s published authors, thus supporting the scholar&rsquo;s claim. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company&rsquo;s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison&rsquo;s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn&rsquo;t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar&rsquo;s claim is about Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison&rsquo;s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison&rsquo;s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar&rsquo;s claim focuses on Morrison&rsquo;s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House&rsquo;s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison&rsquo;s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House. </p>",

The text then goes on to speculate as to why this may have been the case, stating that participants likely considered the messages from the former trial volunteers to be more convincing than the messages from the doctors because the former trial volunteers were perceived as having undergone the same experience that the participants were considering.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren&rsquo;t considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that it wasn&rsquo;t possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd&rsquo;a&scaron;tart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins&rsquo; weight.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon&rsquo;s financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised&mdash;that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade&mdash;likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it&rsquo;s unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren&rsquo;t considered suitable for trade, so Abd&rsquo;a&scaron;tart I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it&rsquo;s unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency.</p>",

The text states that Suarez, P&eacute;rez-Huerta, and Harrell&rsquo;s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers&rsquo; claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that it&rsquo;s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn&rsquo;t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers&rsquo; claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn&rsquo;t weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn&rsquo;t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers&rsquo; claim. </p>",

According to the text, Jia Hu and colleagues \"hypothesized that workplace leaders who reflect on lessons learned from past mistakes are likely to exhibit more humility than leaders who don&rsquo;t engage in such reflection.\" The bar graph shows the humility scores for managers who participated in Jia Hu and colleagues&rsquo; study. It shows average humility scores for managers who reflected on a past mistake that they learned from, managers who reflected on a past mistake that they didn&rsquo;t learn from, and managers who were in the control group that, according to the text, simply reflected on their daily routines. The graph shows that managers who reflected on a past mistake they learned from received an average humility score between 3.0 and 3.5. Both the control group and managers who reflected on a mistake they didn&rsquo;t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reflected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it&rsquo;s true that none of the group&rsquo;s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups&rsquo; average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn&rsquo;t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reflected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reflected on a mistake they didn&rsquo;t learn from. Furthermore, the idea that the managers in the control group exhibited only slightly less humility on average than the managers in the two experimental groups did would not support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct. Choice D is incorrect because there is no indication in the graph that all three groups of participants exhibited less humility on average than the researchers expected. The graph and text don&rsquo;t cite any specific expectations that the researchers had with regard to the humility scores for each group.</p>",

The text begins with Miranda responding to Prospero&rsquo;s claim that she probably doesn&rsquo;t remember her life before the island. She describes a distant memory, asking if she had \"four or five women\" caring for her. Prospero confirms this (\"thou hadst\") and then asks what else she can recall, stating that because she remembers one thing from the time before she lived on the island (\"ought ere thou camest here\"), she might also remember arriving on the island (\"how thou camest here\"). That is, Prospero indicates that Miranda&rsquo;s ability to summon details of an experience from before her arrival on the island suggests that she may also be able to summon details of her arrival.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Prospero doesn&rsquo;t say anything about how Miranda presents her early childhood memory of having several people care for her&mdash;he indicates only his surprise that she remembers something from so long ago (\"the dark backward and abysm of time\") and his thought that she may also be able to recall another childhood event: her arrival on the island. Further, Prospero doesn&rsquo;t suggest that he believes Miranda is discontent in her current circumstances. Choice B is incorrect. Although Miranda suggests some doubt about her recollection of a place other than the island, in that she describes it as \"like a dream\" she can&rsquo;t be certain of, Prospero doesn&rsquo;t mention her uncertainty&mdash;though he himself wonders how it is possible that she correctly recalls something from so long ago (\"abysm of time\"). Rather than indicating that doubt is making Miranda reluctant, Prospero simply states that Miranda may have the ability to remember traveling to the island. Choice D is incorrect. Although Miranda describes a vague impression of several people who cared for her as a young child and states that it is \"rather like a dream\" instead of something she is certain is real, Prospero doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Miranda is remembering a childhood daydream. Instead, he confirms that what Miranda remembers actually happened, answering her question about having had caregivers with \"thou hadst,\" and asks her what else she can remember from long ago.</p>",

The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH<sub>3</sub> could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH<sub>3</sub> without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH<sub>3</sub> serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH<sub>3</sub> in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub>. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH<sub>3</sub> to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH<sub>3</sub> usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH<sub>3</sub> in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH<sub>3</sub> as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub> that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas.</p>",

One reason for Izquierdo&rsquo;s relative obscurity is the enormous popularity of some of her peers. In particular, the painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera have so captivated the interest of US audiences that Izquierdo and other Mexican artists from the period often get overlooked, despite the high quality of their work.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately uses data from the table to complete the statement about certain rotating radio transients (RRATs). The table contains information about the right ascensions, periods, and frequencies of various pulsar stars called RRATs. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is defined as the time between consecutive pulses. The table shows that the period of RRAT J0614-03 is 0.136 seconds, which is the lowest number of all the periods of the RRATs listed in the table. If the period is the time between consecutive pulses, and J0614-03 has the shortest period, then J0614-03 has the shortest amount of time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, J0545-03 has a period of 1.074 seconds and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses. Therefore, since J0545-03 and J0121+53 have different periods, they do not have the same amount of time between consecutive pulses. Choice C is incorrect because according to the table, J1654-2335 has a period of 0.545 seconds, which is not the longest period of all the RRATs listed in the table. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and both J0545-03 and J0121+53 have longer periods than J1654-2335, so J1654-2335 does not have the longest time between consecutive pulses of all the RRATs in the table. Choice D is incorrect because according to the table, J0103+54 has a period of 0.354 seconds, and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. According to the text, the period of an RRAT is the time between consecutive pulses, and only J0121+53 has more than one second of time between consecutive pulses, not J0103+54.</p>",

One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms&rsquo; limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student&rsquo;s assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn&rsquo;t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China&rsquo;s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn&rsquo;t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms&rsquo; assets&mdash;and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports&mdash;were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn&rsquo;t address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn&rsquo;t address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.</p>",

The text explains that the LNH holds that there is an inverse relationship between the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity) and the grammatical complexity of that language&mdash;that is, that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity decreases, and vice versa. According to the text, Shcherbakova and colleagues focused on two positive indications of grammatical complexity&mdash;fusion and informativity&mdash;and analyzed their occurrence in over 1,300 languages. If the researchers found a slightly positive correlation between fusion and exotericity and between informativity and exotericity&mdash;meaning that to some extent, grammatical complexity increases as the number of non-native speakers of a language increases&mdash;their outcome would not be consistent with the assumption that exotericity and grammatical complexity are inversely related (the LNH).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to say that a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and both fusion and informativity is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH, since the finding would address only grammatical complexity (given that fusion and informativity are aspects of grammatical complexity) and wouldn&rsquo;t move beyond that factor to address its relationship to the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity), which is the relationship the LNH focuses on. Choice B is incorrect because a finding of a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and the prevalence of non-native speakers of a language (exotericity)&mdash;meaning that as the number of non-native speakers increases, grammatical complexity somewhat decreases, and vice versa&mdash;would be consistent, not inconsistent, with the LNH, since the text indicates that according to the LNH, there is an inverse relationship between grammatical complexity and exotericity; a negative correlation reflects an inverse relationship.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text&rsquo;s discussion of scholars&rsquo; understanding of Maya ecology and agricultural marketplaces. The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn&rsquo;t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don&rsquo;t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn&rsquo;t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren&rsquo;t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have marketplaces, it wouldn&rsquo;t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don&rsquo;t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn&rsquo;t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn&rsquo;t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn&rsquo;t have any need for marketplaces. The scholars&rsquo; mistaken belief has no bearing on the issue of whether farmers met their own needs before trading their products. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from &ldquo;Odalie&rdquo; to illustrate the claim that Odalie is eager to escape the monotony, or tedious lack of variety, of her everyday life. In the quotation, Odalie describes feeling &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; and complains that she has &ldquo;no companions&rdquo; except for her &ldquo;sleepy tante.&rdquo; Odalie goes on to say that, as a result, her life is &ldquo;dull&rdquo; and she is &ldquo;ready for any new sensation,&rdquo; meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes to get away from her monotonous everyday life. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation includes the word &ldquo;tiresome,&rdquo; which means dull, it does so to suggest Odalie&rsquo;s negative feelings about Mardi Gras, which is a once-a-year celebration, not her feelings about her everyday life. This quotation therefore doesn&rsquo;t express that Odalie&rsquo;s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn&rsquo;t express that Odalie&rsquo;s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has &ldquo;quaint windows&rdquo; and a &ldquo;green and cool&rdquo; courtyard that is &ldquo;made musical&rdquo; by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds. Choice D is incorrect because this quotation describes the lively sounds of a Mardi Gras celebration that Odalie hears through her window, not the monotony of Odalie&rsquo;s everyday life or her wish to escape. </p>",

The text describes a disagreement among scholars about whether Mexican-American folklore mostly derived from the folklore of Spain or originated in Mexico and the United States as cultures there have interacted. The latter view is the argument that Paredes puts forward. If Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes&rsquo;s argument, since it would suggest that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes&rsquo;s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes&rsquo;s argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes&rsquo;s argument that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, since Paredes argued that Mexican-American folklore is the product of various cultures interacting in Mexico and the United States, he would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because scholars&rsquo; previous ignorance of the folklore would have no bearing on Paredes&rsquo;s argument that Mexican-American folklore mostly reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States.
