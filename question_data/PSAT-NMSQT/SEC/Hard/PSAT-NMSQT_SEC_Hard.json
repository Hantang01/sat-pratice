Furthermore, the dash after \"sculptures\" pairs with the dash after \"photographs\" to separate these two supplementary elements from the rest of the sentence. The pair of dashes, which operate at a higher organizing level than the comma, indicates that the elements between the dashes function together&mdash;in this case, the second supplement (\"from&hellip;sculptures\") describes the range of items mentioned in the first supplement&mdash;and could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence.

Choice C is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. The two supplementary elements \"both&hellip;described\" and \"from&hellip;sculptures\" function together to describe the photographs, and placing a dash between them would make this relationship less clear, suggesting that the supplement \"both...described\" is a standalone element that could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence, which isn&rsquo;t the case. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. A colon isn&rsquo;t conventionally used in this way to separate a supplementary element (\"from hair to grass to sculptures\") from the noun phrase it is modifying (\"items they described\").
