Choice B is incorrect. While the nonfinite to-infinitive &ldquo;to force&rdquo; could be used to form a subordinate clause that supplements the main clause (&ldquo;those...cover&rdquo;), to-infinitives conventionally express purpose, and nothing in the sentence suggests that the food sources become unavailable for the purpose of forcing monkeys to hunt marine animals. Choice D is incorrect because the finite past tense verb &ldquo;forced&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be used in this way to supplement the main clause (&ldquo;those...cover&rdquo;). </p>",
