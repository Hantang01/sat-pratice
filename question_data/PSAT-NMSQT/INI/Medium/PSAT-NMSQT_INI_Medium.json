    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the claim in the underlined sentence. The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros&rsquo;s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character&rsquo;s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, <em>The House on Mango Street</em> inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn&rsquo;t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren&rsquo;t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella&rsquo;s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren&rsquo;t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that <em>The House on Mango Street</em> has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn&rsquo;t relate directly to the text&rsquo;s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros&rsquo;s <em>The House on Mango Stree</em>t would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros&rsquo;s novella, such similarities wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how <em>The House on Mango Street</em> had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella&rsquo;s influence.&nbsp;</p>",

The graph shows that the CNO-treated females were way more active than the CNO-treated males, while the saline-treated males and females (the control groups) had very similar activity levels. This supports the claim that there were sex-specific differences in the mice&rsquo;s response to neuron activation. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph. All four groups of mice started at nearly the same activity level before treatment (see how all four points are very close together at -4 minutes, meaning four minutes before treatment). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn&rsquo;t complete the assertion. The assertion is about the mice&rsquo;s response to neuron activation, so we need to include the data about the CNO-treated females and males. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the graph.

estrogen-responsive neurons on energy expenditure, biologist Stephanie Correa et al. treated female and male mice with either saline solution or clozapine-N4-oxide (CNO), which activates the neurons. Monitoring the activity levels of the mice by measuring how frequently the animals broke infrared beams crossing their enclosures, Correa et al. found that the mice in their study showed sex-specific differences in response to neuron activation: <span aria-hidden=\"true\">______</span><span class=\"sr-only\">blank</span></p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about critics&rsquo; skepticism of Bosco Verticale that is supported by the text. The text states that Boeri&rsquo;s design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics&rsquo; concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri&rsquo;s goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale&rsquo;s balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.</p>",

The graph presents percentages of maize exported by Argentina, Brazil, and the United States in marketing years 2009/2010 to 2013/2014 and indicates that for the marketing year 2012/2013, the percentage of maize exported by Argentina decreased to about 70 percent from about 80 percent in the previous marketing year.

Moreover, the graph shows that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil remained higher, not lower, than the percentage exported by the United States in the marketing year 2012/2013. Choice B is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by Brazil never exceeded the percentage exported by Argentina for any of the marketing years represented. Choice D is incorrect because the graph indicates that the percentage of maize exported by the United States reached its lowest point, not its highest, during the five marketing years in 2012/2013, with the United States exporting only about 8 percent of its maize in that marketing year.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about average rainfall in September in select Puerto Rican cities. The graph shows that between 1981 and 2010 Rinc&oacute;n, Ponce, and Isabela all had an average rainfall during the month of September of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti&aacute;n had an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Describing the average September rainfall of Rinc&oacute;n, Ponce, and Isabela as below 8 inches and the average September rainfall of San Sebasti&aacute;n as greater than 8 inches therefore offers an accurate description of the data in the graph and most effectively completes the statement. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it offers an inaccurate interpretation of the data in the graph. The graph shows that in September, Rinc&oacute;n, Isabela, and Ponce all have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, and San Sebasti&aacute;n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches. Therefore, Rinc&oacute;n&rsquo;s average rainfall is the same as, not greater than, that of Isabela and Ponce, and it is below, not greater than, that of San Sebasti&aacute;n. Choice B is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph. In September, Rinc&oacute;n and Ponce have an average rainfall of about 6 inches, not 5 inches; Isabela has an average rainfall of about 6 inches, not 10 inches; and San Sebasti&aacute;n has an average rainfall of nearly 11 inches, not 10 inches. Choice D is incorrect because although the graph shows a similar average rainfall (about 6 inches) for Rinc&oacute;n and Isabela in September, it doesn&rsquo;t show that Ponce has a similar average rainfall to San Sebasti&aacute;n during this month. In September, Ponce&rsquo;s average rainfall is about 6 inches, whereas San Sebasti&aacute;n&rsquo;s average rainfall is nearly 11 inches. </p>",

Choice B is incorrect because it isn&rsquo;t supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that she&rsquo;s excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn&rsquo;t supported by the text: there&rsquo;s no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her mother is a bad role model.

In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture.

The text goes on to describe Heidi&rsquo;s eyes as &ldquo;glowing&rdquo; and states that she &ldquo;devoured the scene,&rdquo; suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail.

Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as &ldquo;looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures&rdquo; in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she&rsquo;s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text&rsquo;s description of the image and Heidi&rsquo;s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear.

It also describes Heidi&rsquo;s eyes as &ldquo;glowing&rdquo; and states that she &ldquo;devoured the scene,&rdquo; suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail.

The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion&mdash;that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers&rsquo; trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue. This finding supports the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to frog-biting midges.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that the majority of frog-biting midges were found in the traps that both played the mating call and released carbon dioxide would present evidence that directly refutes the researchers&rsquo; conclusion&mdash;that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the frog-biting midges regarding the location of t&uacute;ngara frogs. Choice B is incorrect because if the midges entered the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide only during or immediately after carbon dioxide was released, that would suggest that the midges used the carbon dioxide as a way to locate their prey, a finding that would contradict the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that carbon dioxide was not an additional cue to the midges. Choice D is incorrect because a trap attracting larger numbers of midges with high carbon dioxide concentrations than a trap with low carbon dioxide concentrations suggests that carbon dioxide might serve as an additional cue to the midges as to the location on the frogs, a finding contrary to the researchers&rsquo; conclusion.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the Jordanelle Dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years&mdash;1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees&mdash;grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues&rsquo; conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn&rsquo;t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.&nbsp;</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the Cretaceous pterosaur <em>Tupandactylus navigans</em>. The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of <em>T.</em> <em>navigans</em> based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons&mdash;namely, that <em>T. navigans</em> had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of <em>T. navigans</em>, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that <em>T. navigans</em> had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make <em>T. navigans</em> different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, <em>T. navigans</em> likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that <em>T. navigans</em> would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that <em>T. navigans </em>had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari&rsquo;s team would not suggest that <em>T. navigans</em> had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of the two types of stick tools used by New Caledonian crows. The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows find and don&rsquo;t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools&mdash;but not the tools without hooks&mdash;in their grasp or in safe places when they aren&rsquo;t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it&rsquo;s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren&rsquo;t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they&rsquo;re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren&rsquo;t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there&rsquo;s no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are. </p>",

The text explains that Grimes used a writing method called the golden shovel to create the poems in her book. According to the text, the method involves basing a new poem on a line from an existing poem. The text then mentions Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson as examples of important Black poets whose lines of poetry form the basis of Grimes&rsquo;s poems. The text goes on to say that this writing method is difficult and that the resulting poems can be awkward, but reviewers have positively reviewed Grimes&rsquo;s book. If the reviewers of <em>One Last Word</em> specifically note that the work is a &ldquo;beautiful and powerful tribute to the poets who inspired it,&rdquo; then they must have appreciated how Grimes used the golden shovel method to pay tribute to other poets. This suggests that Grimes was successful in using the golden shovel method to achieve her goal of honoring Black poets in her book. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the reaction suggests that most reviewers did understand Grimes&rsquo;s goal for her book.

Choice C is incorrect. Although it&rsquo;s likely that Grimes sought to honor Hughes and Johnson in her book of poetry because they&rsquo;re among her favorite poets, this fact isn&rsquo;t suggested by the reviewers&rsquo; positive reaction to her book. Instead, the reaction suggests that Grimes was successful in her use of the golden shovel method.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether other writers were inspired by Grimes to use the golden shovel method in their poetry. The text mentions the poets Hughes and Johnson as examples of poets honored in Grimes&rsquo;s book and describes reviewers&rsquo; positive reception of her book, but it doesn&rsquo;t detail Grimes&rsquo;s impact on other writers. </p>",

This choice indicates that the approximately 285 medicine and health topics submitted in 2019 are more than the number of medicine and health submissions in any other year shown&mdash;a description that is supported by information in the graph, which shows that medicine and health topic submissions were below 250 in 2016, 2017, and 2018, but above 250 (approximately 285 submissions) in 2019.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t support the underlined claim or accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice refers to 2016 and discusses cellular and molecular biology and animal science, whereas the underlined claim refers to 2019 and discusses medicine and health. Moreover, the claim that in 2016 there were equal numbers of submissions in the cellular and molecular biology category and in the animal science category is contradicted by the graph, which shows approximately 200 submissions and 50 submissions, respectively, for those categories in 2016. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the information in the graph. This choice claims that in 2019 there were more physics and space submissions than there were medicine and health submissions, but the graph shows that there were approximately 100 space and science submissions that year and approximately 285 medicine and health submissions. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the information in the graph or support the underlined claim about medicine and health research topics. This choice claims that there were approximately 95 submissions for the animal science category in 2016, but the graph shows that the number was closer to 50 in 2016.</p>",

The text explains that a research team evaluated the study&rsquo;s participants using various measures in order to learn whether there might be a medical benefit to telling patients they&rsquo;re receiving a placebo. The table shows the team&rsquo;s mean ratings for participants after 21 days for three of the measures: global improvement, symptom severity reduction, and quality of life improvement. According to the table, the mean ratings were higher for all three measures for participants aware of taking a placebo than for participants in the control group. Given that higher ratings indicate greater well-being, as the text states, the mean ratings in the table indicate greater overall well-being for participants aware of taking a placebo than for participants in the control group.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the table doesn&rsquo;t include data about individual participants; rather, it presents means, or mathematical averages, of ratings. For this reason, no conclusions can be drawn from data in the table about the extent to which well-being may have varied from participant to participant. Choice B is incorrect because according to the table, the mean ratings for participants aware of taking a placebo were higher for all three measures than for participants in the control group, not lower for two of the measures. Choice C is incorrect because it cites data from the table related to participants in the control group, not to participants aware of taking a placebo. Additionally, the mean ratings in the table for participants aware of taking a placebo are higher for all three measures than for participants in the control group.

The text states that much of the ship&rsquo;s wooden hull was found in a quarry. The text also states that wood rots quickly unless it is protected by sediment, which shields the wood from exposure to oxygen. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the surviving portion of the ship&rsquo;s hull was covered by an oxygen-shielding layer of sediment.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests other ships have been or are likely to be found in the same quarry. The fact that much of this ship&rsquo;s wood survived for centuries in the quarry does raise the possibility that there might be other preserved ships, but the text provides no support for such a conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not address the type of wood used in sixteenth-century ships or any theories pertaining to wood choice in ships. Choice D is incorrect because the text states only that the ship is from the sixteenth century, with no other dates offered for its construction, and thus there is no basis to consider alternative ages for the ship.

The text begins by stating that Mar&iacute;a Izquierdo was an important figure in the history of twentieth-century Mexican art, but despite her importance, her work hasn&rsquo;t received widespread recognition in the United States. According to the text, one reason for this is that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera are so famous in the US that they overshadow other important Mexican artists, including Izquierdo. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Izquierdo&rsquo;s work is less well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw most of the public&rsquo;s attention. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss the appearance of Izquierdo&rsquo;s paintings in galleries in the US during her lifetime, nor does it suggest that her paintings were displayed more frequently than paintings by Kahlo or Rivera were. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Izquierdo has been overlooked in the US because of Kahlo&rsquo;s and Rivera&rsquo;s greater popularity. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss either the subject matter of Izquierdo&rsquo;s paintings or the techniques she used, nor does it compare these aspects of her paintings with those of Kahlo&rsquo;s and Rivera&rsquo;s paintings.

The graph shows that in 2010, the number of computer services jobs was approximately 6,000, which is the same approximate number of jobs in engineering services. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of jobs in technical consulting services and the number of jobs in computer services were about the same, at approximately 5,000.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the graph shows that in 2010 the number of computer services jobs (about 6,000) was higher than the number of  technical consulting services jobs (about 4,000), in 2019 the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not about the same as the number of engineering services jobs (about 6,000). Choice C is incorrect because according to the graph, the number of jobs in computer services was lower than the number of jobs in engineering services in 2019, not 2010. Additionally, the graph shows that in 2019, the number of computer services jobs (about 5,000) was not higher than the number of jobs in engineering services (about 6,000). Choice D is incorrect because the graph shows that the number of computer services jobs was about the same as the number of technical consulting services jobs in 2019, not 2010. This also means the number of computer services jobs could not have been lower than the technical consulting services jobs in 2019 if they were about the same.</p>",

The text explains that the sea stars tend to move to higher shore levels at night in search of prey, but after a heavy rain, the sea stars stay at lower shore levels. Garza and Robles hypothesize that rainfall results in a layer of fresh water that the sea stars don&rsquo;t cross. To determine whether fresh water forms a barrier to sea stars, Garza and Robles observed how sea stars behaved in a tank of only seawater and in a tank of seawater with a layer of fresh water on top. If the sea stars climbed to the top of the tank with only seawater but stopped climbing just below the layer of fresh water in the other tank, that would suggest that fresh water does indeed serve as a barrier to the sea stars, thereby supporting Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that sea stars in the tank with only seawater moved around the bottom of the tank more than sea stars in the other tank did but that none of the stars in either tank climbed to the top would be irrelevant to Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis. Such a finding would reveal nothing about whether fresh water serves as a barrier to sea stars. Choice C is incorrect because finding that sea stars climbed to the top of both tanks would weaken, not support, Garza and Robles&rsquo;s hypothesis, since it would indicate that the layer of fresh water wasn&rsquo;t a barrier to the sea stars.

It follows, then, that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed&mdash;that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn&rsquo;t address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere.

The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again.</p>",

The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that St&ouml;ger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low-pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support St&ouml;ger and her team&rsquo;s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because finding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on St&ouml;ger and her team&rsquo;s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, St&ouml;ger and her team&rsquo;s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because finding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support St&ouml;ger and her team&rsquo;s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because finding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support St&ouml;ger and her team&rsquo;s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different species could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could not conclude anything about the function of giraffe humming from a finding that some other animals in zoos also hum.&nbsp;</p>",

The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items&rsquo; new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll make an unplanned purchase. This quotation from a surveyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously purchased a notebook while looking for cleaning supplies that weren&rsquo;t in their usual place.

Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn&rsquo;t find some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to coupons that the shopper received, not to a new store layout. Thus, the quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn&rsquo;t carry those products, so the quotation doesn&rsquo;t support the researchers&rsquo; explanation that rearranging a store&rsquo;s layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases.</p>",

The graph shows the number of organic farms located in each of six US states in 2016: between 2,600 and 2,800 in California; between 1,200 and 1,400 in Wisconsin; between 1,000 and 1,200 in New York; approximately 800 in Pennsylvania; and between 600 and 800 in both Iowa and Washington.&nbsp;The last sentence of the text provides information about the number of organic farms in 2016, first describing the number in California. The best completion of the sentence is the choice that accurately describes the number of organic farms in 2016 in another state, which the assertion that Washington had between 600 and 800 organic farms provides. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. The graph indicates that there were between 1,000 and 1,200 organic farms in New York, not fewer than 800 organic farms.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. While the graph indicates that there were between 1,200 and 1,400 organic farms in Wisconsin in 2016, there were only between 600 and 800 in Iowa. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately reflect the data from the graph. The graph indicates that in 2016 there were approximately 800 organic farms in Pennsylvania, not more than 1,200.&nbsp;</p>",

The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain&rsquo;s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony&rsquo;s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can influence how a language develops. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether.

artifacts dating to 800,000 to 1,000,000 years ago have been recovered from the Evron Quarry in Israel. Likely created by the hominin <em>Homo erectus</em>, the artifacts have no visual features suggesting that they were exposed to fire, leading some scholars to conclude that these hominins had not acquired control of fire. But Zane Stepka and colleagues recently used a new method to determine whether these artifacts had been exposed to temperatures above 400°C (the typical temperature campfires reach) and concluded that the hominins who inhabited the site may have had control of fire. </p>",

Choice C is incorrect because while the text discusses the general origins of the pronoun \"y&rsquo;all,\" it does not state when the use of the pronoun was first recorded in the English language. Choice D is incorrect because though the text addresses the use of the pronoun \"y&rsquo;all\" within English-speaking communities in the US, it does not address its use outside of that geographic area.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur&rsquo;s 2021 analysis of the Vinland Map. The text indicates that while some scholars have believed that the map was drawn in the mid-1400s, the 2021 analysis showed the presence of the compound titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the map. The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn&rsquo;t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn&rsquo;t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn&rsquo;t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn&rsquo;t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn&rsquo;t available until the early 1900s doesn&rsquo;t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn&rsquo;t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn&rsquo;t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn&rsquo;t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge&mdash;and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers&mdash;of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s.&nbsp;Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn&rsquo;t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude that the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn&rsquo;t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is incorrect because although the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the ink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than the early 1900s. This finding, in turn, led the team to conclude that the Vinland Map couldn&rsquo;t have been drawn in the mid-1400s. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that support the researchers&rsquo; conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe production. The bar graph shows the cantaloupe yield for plants grown with nitrogen fertilizer and for those grown with a control fertilizer (without nitrogen) for three consecutive years (2017&ndash;2019). For each year in the graph, the yield for the nitrogen group is greater than the yield for the control group. In pounds per acre, the value in 2017 for the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 30 while the control-group yield is less than 25; in 2018 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 40 while the control-group yield is less than 35; and in 2019 the nitrogen-group yield is greater than 25 while the control-group yield is less than 20. Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre.

Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.&nbsp;</p>",

The possibility of not having a suitable habitat would be especially concerning for the candidate species for which the most time has passed since its extinction.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the biologists&rsquo; claim. The text accompanying the graph describes the efforts of the California Condor Recovery Program, which is working to protect the condor from extinction. The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program&rsquo;s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200. Thus, the biologists&rsquo; claim about the program&rsquo;s success is supported by data from the graph showing that the number of wild California condors increased overall from 2014 to 2020 and exceeded the number of those living in captivity.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The number of captive California condors did not steadily decrease between 2014 and 2020: rather, it increased slightly during some years and decreased slightly during others, generally remaining at slightly less than 200. Choice B is incorrect. Even though the graph does show a slight decrease in both the captive and wild condor populations from 2019 to 2020, such a decrease during a particular year would not demonstrate the program&rsquo;s success. Choice C is incorrect because it does not accurately describe data from the graph. The difference between the number of captive and wild California condors did not remain relatively steady between 2014 and 2017. While the number of captive condors remained roughly the same during that period, the number of wild condors increased, so the difference between the number of captive and wild condors increased as well.</p>",

Although finding that aquatic reptiles and fish can provide nutrients that land mammals typically do not provide could help explain why some animals eat those reptiles and fish, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in particular eat those reptiles and fish and thus would not support the researchers&rsquo; claim. Choice D is incorrect because finding that when preying on mammals, jaguars prefer semiaquatic mammals, such as capybaras, would be irrelevant to the researchers&rsquo; claim that the jaguars can survive on a diet of more fish and aquatic reptiles than mammals. The type of mammals the jaguars tend to eat does not indicate anything about whether fish and aquatic reptiles are part of the jaguars&rsquo; diet.</p>",

The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn&rsquo;t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with findings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging.</p>",

Choice D is incorrect because the text does not indicate any uncertainty about the reason for the ice ridges on Europa and, in fact, clearly states that researchers now claim to know the mechanism that created the ridges.</p>",
