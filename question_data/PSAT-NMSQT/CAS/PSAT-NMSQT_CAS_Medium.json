It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"genuine,\" or actual and true, while the one by Salazar&rsquo;s team wasn&rsquo;t, since the text treats the finding by Salazar&rsquo;s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate (\"it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought\").

It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was \"intentional,\" or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar&rsquo;s team wasn&rsquo;t; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu.

The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them.

The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records.

The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly (\"she was still in the B&rsquo;s\") and that she struggled with some books (\"some of the B&rsquo;s had been hard going\"), she doesn&rsquo;t give up because she thinks of herself as \"a reader.\" These details show Francie&rsquo;s resolve.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn&rsquo;t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the \"dry ones\"&mdash;that is, the boring books&mdash;and that some of the books were \"hard going,\" meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss Francie&rsquo;s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it&rsquo;s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn&rsquo;t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott) whose book Francie has read as well as several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) she has encountered, the text doesn&rsquo;t say whether Francie admires any of the books she&rsquo;s read so far. Instead, the text focuses on the time and effort she devotes to reaching her goal of reading all the books in the world&mdash;even ones she doesn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"&mdash;that is, comparatively very little&mdash;in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel&rsquo;s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there&rsquo;s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn&rsquo;t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t imply that graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written&mdash;that is, well crafted&mdash;as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it represents how the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through text-based interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotional contagion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn&rsquo;t the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a flawed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn&rsquo;t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity. Instead, Text 1 claims that physical interaction is required for emotional contagion to occur, and Text 2 describes a study that suggests emotional contagion can occur in text-based online interactions.</p>",

The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped &ldquo;aesthetic sense,&rdquo; or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as &ldquo;messy things&rdquo; and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside.

Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn&rsquo;t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla&rsquo;s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne&rsquo;s personality. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"sheltering\" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has \"stole[n] away\" the speaker&rsquo;s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting&rsquo;s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"&mdash;a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker&rsquo;s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can&rsquo;t return the speaker&rsquo;s love. The text continues by stating that there&rsquo;s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof&rsquo;s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive&mdash;that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn&rsquo;t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.</p>",

The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"repeatable\" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because \"explicable\" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly. Choice C is incorrect because \"regrettable\" means distressing or unfortunate, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Imara believes the researchers regret the star formations or find them distressing, but rather that she uses interactive models to physically study them.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author&rsquo;s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

In the first sentence of the text, the narrator states that she thinks there&rsquo;s a chance she will become part of the basketball team at her college. She goes on to explain that she is \"quick\" and \"tough.\" Based on these characteristics, she thinks she has a chance to join the team. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses solely on basketball and doesn&rsquo;t mention any other kinds of sports. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t describe aspects of the game of basketball. Instead, it provides the narrator&rsquo;s reasoning for thinking that she might make her school basketball team. Choice C is incorrect. Although the narrator explains why she thinks she will be chosen for the basketball team at her school, the text doesn&rsquo;t go into the general decision-making process or the requirements for being picked for the team.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing \"similarities with\" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren&rsquo;t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren&rsquo;t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can&rsquo;t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn&rsquo;t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.</p>",
