    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer&rsquo;s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer&rsquo;s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn&rsquo;t appear to contain any life. Fierer&rsquo;s team says that though this doesn&rsquo;t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer&rsquo;s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer&rsquo;s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer&rsquo;s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn&rsquo;t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer&rsquo;s team wouldn&rsquo;t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn&rsquo;t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn&rsquo;t detect them, but the author doesn&rsquo;t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer&rsquo;s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>",

Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say &ldquo;[m]ore recently&rdquo; Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but &ldquo;that European breeds lack,&rdquo; which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira&rsquo;s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey&rsquo;s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues&rsquo; evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey&rsquo;s evidence is. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from &ldquo;1321&ndash;1407 CE&mdash;over a century before Europeans invaded the region&rdquo; and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey&rsquo;s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey&rsquo;s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens.&nbsp;</p>",

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi&rsquo;s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi&rsquo;s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn&rsquo;t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.</p>",

Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1&rsquo;s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s observations about EGR in humans. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven&rsquo;t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t say that Text 1&rsquo;s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1&rsquo;s excitement as premature and overly optimistic.

The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can \"exceed,\" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can \"encompass,\" or enclose or encircle, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can \"conceal,\" or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel. Instead, the text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p>",

Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others.

The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she&rsquo;s in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It&rsquo;s the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn&rsquo;t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily&rsquo;s feelings. </p>",

Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is \"arcane,\" or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it&rsquo;s now defunct.

The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them.

This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people&rsquo;s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people&rsquo;s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries&rsquo; varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>",

Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other.

Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals&rsquo; curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.</p>",

The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same&mdash;posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood.

Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.</p>",

The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega&rsquo;s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn&rsquo;t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research.

The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months&rsquo; work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer&rsquo;s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of.

Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text&mdash;that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>",

The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don&rsquo;t behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter &ldquo;patches of low species richness&rdquo;&mdash;that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species&mdash;they&rsquo;ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources.

Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t convey any implications of, or consequences of or conclusions drawn from, the fact that the mass of the subatomic particle differed from expectations; the context indicates only that the actual measured mass was much higher than the predicted mass.</p>",

This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is &ldquo;aggressive,&rdquo; or threatening. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is &ldquo;evolving,&rdquo; or advancing. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is &ldquo;advantageous,&rdquo; or helpful. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old&mdash;much older than the Clovis people&rsquo;s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces&mdash;that they are human-made tools&mdash;that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group&rsquo;s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn&rsquo;t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group&rsquo;s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.</p>",
