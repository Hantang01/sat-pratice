    "rationale": "<p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer&rsquo;s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer&rsquo;s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn&rsquo;t appear to contain any life. Fierer&rsquo;s team says that though this doesn&rsquo;t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer&rsquo;s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer&rsquo;s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer&rsquo;s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn&rsquo;t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer&rsquo;s team wouldn&rsquo;t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn&rsquo;t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer&rsquo;s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn&rsquo;t detect them, but the author doesn&rsquo;t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer&rsquo;s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>",

This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is &ldquo;involuntarily framing advertisements&rdquo; (meaning that she can&rsquo;t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new &ldquo;situations&rdquo; (or jobs) would be like.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane&rsquo;s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane&rsquo;s thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she finds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also finds that situation satisfying&mdash;she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she &ldquo;should&rdquo; quit her current job (indicating that she hasn&rsquo;t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts &ldquo;might germinate and bear fruit if they could,&rdquo; meaning that the thoughts haven&rsquo;t yet led to a decision&mdash;that Jane isn&rsquo;t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else. </p>",

Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn&rsquo;t provide an example of that knowledge.

On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specific elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specific temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>\n<p>A new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specific elevations.

It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live.</p>",

Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions.

Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez&rsquo;s works.

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi&rsquo;s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi&rsquo;s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi&rsquo;s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn&rsquo;t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.</p>",

The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and flowers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks \"stately and calm,\" the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was \"wide open to the long-expected guest,\" which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne&rsquo;s anticipation and Martha&rsquo;s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest&rsquo;s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was \"long-expected,\" but characterizing Miss Pyne as \"stately and calm\" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and flowers and birds singing).</p>",

The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text&rsquo;s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn&rsquo;t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians&rsquo; approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas. </p>",

Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as &ldquo;especially promising&rdquo; and a sign of &ldquo;exciting progress&rdquo; in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR&rsquo;s function in humans isn&rsquo;t yet known, it&rsquo;s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1&rsquo;s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s observations about EGR in humans. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven&rsquo;t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn&rsquo;t say that Text 1&rsquo;s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1&rsquo;s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s findings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1&rsquo;s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn&rsquo;t at all dismissive of Srivastava&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s findings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There&rsquo;s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1&rsquo;s praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful.&nbsp;</p>",

This context establishes that these remains&rsquo; entry into the fossil record was sudden. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the word &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was &ldquo;catastrophic,&rdquo; or disastrous. In context, &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record&mdash;a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is &ldquo;elusive,&rdquo; or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as &ldquo;imminent,&rdquo; or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago. </p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe&rsquo;s novel <em>Soldier of the Mist</em>. In this context, \"preserve\" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because \"suspect\" would mean mistrust, which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"suggest\" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"imagine\" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it&rsquo;s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he&rsquo;s fabricating the experiences he records.</p>",

The next sentence explains that the CEP organized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists&mdash;more than 7,000&mdash;who participated in the workshops.

Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to &ldquo;illustrate,&rdquo; or demonstrate, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes. According to the text, carbon nanotubes allow molecules to be transmitted to plant cells&mdash;something that is otherwise difficult to do. The text therefore presents carbon nanotubes as a way of possibly solving a problem, not as a means of demonstrating the problem. </p>",

The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city&rsquo;s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit and cultural life.

Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn&rsquo;t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals&mdash;or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as &ldquo;a living showcase of San Francisco&rsquo;s artistic spirit,&rdquo; the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District. </p>",

Although the text suggests that Sara makes up \"wonderful things,\" nothing suggests that she does so to mislead, or intentionally deceive, others; there is no reason to assume that Sara&rsquo;s listeners don&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;s creating the stories she shares. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, \"wonderful things\" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them \"lovely or alarming\" for her listeners. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is discovering, or unexpectedly finding, \"wonderful things\" in the stories she loves to tell; rather, that she is making things up as she tells the stories.</p>",

In this context, &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly&mdash;that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm&mdash;each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because &ldquo;quantities&rdquo; means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn&rsquo;t mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences.

Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, &ldquo;agreements&rdquo; would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about. Since fireflies aren&rsquo;t capable of making such agreements, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to use this word to refer to the signals they send each other with their flashes. </p>",

In this context, &ldquo;commonalities with&rdquo; means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuac&aacute;n (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuac&aacute;n influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuac&aacute;n. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows &ldquo;refinements of,&rdquo; or improvements on, Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it&rsquo;s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, the Tikal citadel&rsquo;s builders improved on it.&nbsp;Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing &ldquo;precursors of&rdquo; Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture&mdash;or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture&mdash;would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuac&aacute;n. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuac&aacute;n, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuac&aacute;n, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, then the Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people&rsquo;s &ldquo;animosities toward,&rdquo; or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuac&aacute;n architecture.&nbsp;</p>",

In arguing that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"&mdash;that is, comparatively very little&mdash;in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel&rsquo;s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn&rsquo;t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there&rsquo;s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn&rsquo;t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t imply that graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written&mdash;that is, well crafted&mdash;as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren&rsquo;t well crafted.</p>",

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text&rsquo;s discussion of birdsong. In this context, \"diminish\" means reduce or lessen. The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can \"exceed,\" or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can \"encompass,\" or enclose or encircle, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can \"conceal,\" or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel. Instead, the text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p>",

The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of \"unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze\"&mdash;that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"developments of solar energy collection\" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there&rsquo;s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"calibrations with\" would most clearly refer to precise adjustments for a particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there&rsquo;s no reason to think that precision in something related to solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated.

The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship.

The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who &ldquo;cite the album as an influence.&rdquo; Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em>. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were influenced by <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em>, it doesn&rsquo;t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album&rsquo;s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em> was not admired on its first release, the text doesn&rsquo;t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an influence. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn&rsquo;t mention any differences between <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em> and the work of Blood Orange and Moses Sumney. </p>",

The text emphasizes Forrest&rsquo;s admiration for Faulkner&rsquo;s style and the fact that Forrest&rsquo;s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner&rsquo;s stylistically. It therefore wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner&rsquo;s style, Forrest failed to remember it.

Text 1 describes Sharif&rsquo;s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction. &nbsp;However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively&mdash;that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others. </p>",

The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has \"stole[n] away\" the speaker&rsquo;s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting&rsquo;s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"&mdash;a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker&rsquo;s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can&rsquo;t return the speaker&rsquo;s love. The text continues by stating that there&rsquo;s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof&rsquo;s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive&mdash;that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn&rsquo;t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there&rsquo;s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.</p>",

The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required &ldquo;a long overland journey.&rdquo; This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire&rsquo;s territory rather than near its center. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco&rsquo;s location within the Aztec Empire as &ldquo;unobtrusive,&rdquo; or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it&rsquo;s not clear how a province&rsquo;s physical location would or wouldn&rsquo;t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco&rsquo;s location was, the text emphasizes the province&rsquo;s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required &ldquo;a long overland journey.&rdquo; Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was &ldquo;concealed,&rdquo; or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn&rsquo;t see it, and being hidden wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring &ldquo;a long overland journey.&rdquo; Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco&rsquo;s location within the Aztec Empire was &ldquo;approximate&rdquo; would mean that the location either wasn&rsquo;t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco&rsquo;s location is known and that it was far from the empire&rsquo;s capital, so there&rsquo;s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location. </p>",

The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpen&ouml;der and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people&rsquo;s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people&rsquo;s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries&rsquo; varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>",

The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues&rsquo; hypothesis regarding this question&mdash;which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer&mdash;and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team&rsquo;s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team&rsquo;s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn&rsquo;t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team&rsquo;s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn&rsquo;t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn&rsquo;t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo&rsquo;s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn&rsquo;t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo&rsquo;s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.</p>",

In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph&rsquo;s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph&rsquo;s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.</p>",

As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren&rsquo;t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn&rsquo;t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn&rsquo;t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s works.</p>",

According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn&rsquo;t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues&rsquo; perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it&rsquo;s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they&rsquo;re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals&rsquo; curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.</p>",

The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same&mdash;posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed&rsquo;s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood.

Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture&rsquo;s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O&rsquo;Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem.

The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega&rsquo;s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn&rsquo;t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn&rsquo;t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe&mdash;nor does any portion of the text.

While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to \"despise,\" or hate, others&rsquo; vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature&mdash;that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author&rsquo;s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo&rsquo;s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn&rsquo;t the only thing that influences flamingos&rsquo; coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos&rsquo; feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a change wouldn&rsquo;t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo&rsquo;s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos&rsquo; shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn&rsquo;t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>",

Choice B is incorrect.

    "rationale": "<p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old&mdash;much older than the Clovis people&rsquo;s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces&mdash;that they are human-made tools&mdash;that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn&rsquo;t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group&rsquo;s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn&rsquo;t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group&rsquo;s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants. Therefore, there&rsquo;s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.</p>",
